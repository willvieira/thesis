abstract = {testing for the statistical significance of com- ponent tests is routinely carried out in a biased fashion that liberally judges far too many tests to be significant The standard Bonferroni technique is described in many general statistics texts. It can be readily shown (e.g., see Miller, 1981) that, if a collection of k tests is simultaneously carried out at the a/k significance level, the probability, on H0,c that at least one component H0,i will be erroneously rejected is less than or equal to a. This inequality does not require that component tests be independent. A major disadvantage of the stan- dard Bonferroni method, however, occurs when more than one component H0,i is false. For example, suppose in the hypothetical correlation table described above that four of the ten correlations were actually different from zero. The standard Bonferroni test has substantially reduced power in detecting more than one false H0,i (see Holm, 1979). To increase power in detecting more than one false Ho0, Holm ( 1979) introduced the sequential Bonferroni technique. To begin the test, select a significance level (a). Next, replace each test statistic by its corresponding P value and rank the P values from smallest (P,) to largest (Pk). First consider the smallest P value (PI). If P, =/{\textless} a/k, then judge that the corresponding test in- dicates significance at the "table-wide" a level; if the inequality is not met, declare that all tests indicate nonsignificance at the table-wide a level. If and only if P, c? a/k, proceed to the second smallest P value (P2). If P2 '? a/(k - 1), then judge this test also to indicate statistical significance at the a table-wide level of significance and proceed to the third smallest P value (P3). If P2 {\textgreater} a/(k - 1), then declare the corresponding test and all other tests with larger P values to indicate nonsignificance at the table-wide a level. Continue in this fashion until the inequality P, c? a/(I + k - i) is not met.},

abstract = {Patterns of pollen dispersal were investigated in a small, isolated, relict population of Pinus sylvestris L., consisting of 36 trees. A total-exclusion battery comprising four chloroplast and two nuclear microsatellites (theoretical paternity exclusion probability EP=0.996) was used to assign paternity to 813 seeds, collected from 34 trees in the stand. Long-distance pollen immigration accounted for 4.3{\%} of observed matings. Self-fertilization rate was very high (0.25), compared with typical values in more widespread populations of the species. The average effective pollen dispersal distance within the stand was 48 m (or 83 m excluding selfs). Half of effective pollen was dispersed within 11 m, and 7{\%} beyond 200 m. A strong correlation was found between the distance to the closest tree and the mean mating-distance calculated for single-tree progenies. The effective pollen dispersal distribution showed a leptokurtic shape, with a large and significant departure from that expected under uniform dispersal. A maximum-likelihood procedure was used to fit an individual pollen dispersal distance probability density function (dispersal kernel). The estimated kernel indicated fairly leptokurtic dispersal (shape parameter b=0.67), with an average pollen dispersal distance of 135 m, and 50{\%} of pollen dispersed beyond 30 m. A marked directionality pattern of pollen dispersal was found, mainly caused by the uneven distribution of trees, coupled with restricted dispersal and unequal male success. Overall, results show that the number and distribution of potential pollen donors in small populations may strongly influence the patterns of effective pollen dispersal.},

abstract = {Summary 1 Eidothea hardeniana (Proteaceae) is a narrow endemic representative of an ancient lineage restricted to a single site in northern New South Wales (Australia). This study aims to identify the life-history traits most likely to have influenced the current distribution pattern of this rain forest tree. 2 Using ecological and molecular analyses we found that its range is limited by the absence of efficient dispersal mechanisms rather than by habitat availability, or as a result of a recent bottleneck or of reproductive failure. 3 Resprouts can take over the position of senesced plants, even in the absence of disturbance, allowing local persistence and the maintenance of genetic diversity. Long-term persistence and preferential outcrossing further favour relatively high levels of diversity (HE = 0.542) despite a small effective population size (Ne = 21.6). 4 We used eight life-history traits to assess if the E. hardeniana findings were valid across 258 local taxa. Current distribution patterns of rain forest species within a species-rich community were accounted for by linking two important components of community assembly theory: dispersal and niche assembly. 5 The interaction of the seed-based dispersal dimension and resprouting potential best explains the current distribution of rare local taxa. Major dimensions of life-history trait variation were identified among local plant species, suggesting that a range of interacting traits contribute to a species' response to environmental variables and mitigate the influence of potentially adverse circumstances. 6 The benefits of merging ecological and genetic approaches to interpret species distribution and population structure are applicable across a broader range of studies. Our findings highlight how currently constrained palaeo-endemic species with small populations in refugial habitats may retain the capacity to both persist and expand in response to changing circumstances and opportunities. This has important implications for species conservation, habitat management and reserve design},

abstract = {Demographic and ecophysiological data for the endangered New Caledonian conifer, Araucaria muelleri (Araucariaceae), were analysed to: (i) evaluate population viability in relation to site conditions and human impacts; and (ii) advance our understanding of how stress-tolerator plant functional traits affect the population dynamic behaviour and conservation requirements of long-lived tree species. Growth, survivorship and recruitment in four A. muelleri populations were monitored across 9 years. Demographic rates were analysed using stage-based transition matrices. Leaf $\delta$13C, {\%}N and photosystem II stress (Fv/Fm) were measured for seedlings, saplings and trees, and leaf mass per area (LMA) for trees, and correlations among ecophysiological and demographic variables explored. Seedling, sapling and tree stem growth were among the slowest, and annual survivorship among the highest, reported for any tree. Transition matrix analyses yielded stable estimated population growth rates, $\lambda$, not significantly different from 1.0 for all populations. Leaf $\delta$13C was positively correlated with seedling and sapling height growth, while daytime photosystem II stress (Fv/Fm) was high in seedlings, but low in saplings and trees. Ecophysiological measures suggest that individuals transition from moisture-limited growth at the seedling stage to nutrient-limited growth as adults. High levels of environmental stress result in slow stand dynamics, characterized by low recruitment and growth rates counterbalanced by equally low mortality rates. These dynamics result in populations with limited capacity to increase in size quickly, but potentially highly vulnerable to decline should the rate of adult mortality increase. This combination of traits is likely typical of extreme stress-tolerator woody species and suggests a conservation focus on the preservation of mature individuals.},

abstract = {The Araucaria angustifolia (Bertol.) Kuntze is a Brazilian native species considered threatened. There is a lack of information and data about the species ecology that could be used as the basis for preservation and management measures. Intending to alleviate the this lack of data, this study was carried out based on a natural population of A. angustifolia occurring in the Forest Genetic Reserve of Ca{\c{c}}ador, located in the Brazilian state of Santa Catarina. The main goal of the present work was to describe the demographic structure of a natural A. angustifolia population. Therefore, the population studied was divided into four classes based on stage and gender: regeneration, juveniles, males and females. The diametric and height structures, sexual ratio, spatial and dependence patterns were evaluated. The results demonstrated that there was a small regeneration ratio and the sexual ratio was around 1:1, as previously expected for the species. In the spatial pattern analysis, aggregation groups appear in all classes studied. The regeneration showed clusters that do not seem to be associated to adult specimens. The natural regeneration occurs, but in low density under forest conditions.},

abstract = {In this study, genetic diversity, inbreeding, spatial genetic structure (SGS), and pollen dispersal are analyzed using ten microsatellite loci from two populations of the dioecious, wind-pollinated, coniferous tree Araucaria angustifolia in Southern Brazil. The study populations include an undisturbed 7 ha A. angustifolia cluster, where all adult trees were mapped and sampled, and an adjacent, long-abandoned, open agricultural area with an aggregated A. angustifolia population. Seeds were collected from 13 seed trees inside the forest cluster and from eight seed trees in the open forest. Our results showed that the adults present high levels of heterozygosity (H o = 0.91) and an absence of inbreeding. However, significant SGS was detected up to 90 m in the forest cluster suggesting that near-neighbor trees are related. The estimate of effective population size was lower than the total number of trees in the cluster (N e/N = 0.19), which can be explained by the presence of SGS in the stand. Substantial external pollen flow was detected in the forest cluster (26 {\%}) and open forest (20 {\%}), indicating that the reproductive population size is greater than the sampled populations, explaining the high genetic diversity in this population. Our results indicate that this site has potential for in and ex situ conservation due to high levels of genetic diversity and gene immigration resulting from pollen flow. Conservation strategies for A. angustifolia should focus not only on forest fragments but should also include the preservation of isolated trees throughout the landscape.},

As sessile long-living plants, they need this high level of genetic variation for adaptation to highly variable environmental conditions. A set of population genetic processes such as the mating system, gene flow, selection, and migration determine the genetic composition of a tree population. First we will give an introduction and overview on the most important processes and their impact on the genetic diversity of tropical trees, and then we will go in more details for some of the processes. The genetic diversity is of fundamental function for the stability of forest ecosystems. Thus adequate measures on gene conservation are very important. We will cover this topic with a specific chapter. More recently with the advance of genomics and molecular genetics, we have a broad set of molecular markers in hand for diagnostic purposes. We highlight as one important application the use of gene markers and DNA bar coding for tree species identification and as a tool to fight against illegal logging. Finally we will give an introduction to tree breeding programs and provenance tests in the tropics.},

abstract = {Many landscape genetic studies promise results that can be applied in conservation management. However, only few landscape genetic studies have been used by practitioners. Here, we identified scientific topics in landscape genetics that need to be addressed before results can more successfully be applied in conservation management. For each topic, weaknesses of common practice in landscape genetic analysis are described by presenting examples from current studies and further recommendations for improvements are outlined. First, we suggest matching the extent of the study area with those of conservation management units and the study species' dispersal potential when designing landscape genetic studies. Second, the quality of the underlying statistical models should be optimised, and models should include variables that are useful for management implementation. Third, to further improve the applicability of landscape genetic studies, thresholds for landscape effects on gene flow should be identified. Fourth, landscape genetic models could be used for the development of conservation planning tools, which ideally also incorporate the above described thresholds. Fifth and as discussed in earlier studies, the use of multiple species and replication at the landscape scale is recommended. Although it appears that only few landscape genetic studies have been applied in practical management until now, examples presented in this article show that landscape genetic methods can provide important information to formulate concrete management implications. Thus, addressing the above-mentioned scientific topics in landscape genetic studies would enhance the benefits of their results for practitioners.},

abstract = {Although theory has demonstrated rather low levels of gene flow are sufficient to counteract opposing mutation, drift, and selection, widespread recognition of the evolutionary importance of gene flow has come slowly. The perceived role of gene flow as an evolutionary force has vacillated over the last century. In the last few decades, new methods and analyses have demonstrated that plant gene flow rates vary tremendously-from nil to very high-depending on the species and specific populations involved, and sometimes over time for individual populations. In many cases, the measured gene flow rates are evolutionarily significant at distances of hundreds and sometimes thousands of meters, occurring at levels sufficient to counteract drift, spread advantageous alleles, or thwart moderate levels of opposing local selection. Gene flow in plants is likely to often act as a cohesive force, uniting individual plant species into real evolutionary units. Also, gene flow can evolve under natural selection, decreasing or increasing. The fact of frequent, but variable, plant gene flow has important consequences for applied issues in which the presence or absence of gene flow might influence the outcome of a policy, regulatory, or management decision. Examples include the unintended spread of engineered genes, the evolution of invasiveness, and conservation. New data-rich genomic techniques allow closer scrutiny of the role of gene flow in plant evolution. Most plant evolutionists now recognize the importance of gene flow, and it is receiving increased recognition from other areas of plant biology as well.},

Within this generalized view, the role and importance of facilitation have been mostly neglected. This study presents a mathematical model of savannas with coupled soil moisture-vegetation dynamics, which includes interspecific competition and environmental disturbance. We find that there exist environmental and climatic conditions where grass facilitation toward trees plays an important role in supporting tree cover and by extension preserving the savanna biome. We, therefore, argue that our theoretical results in combination with the first empirical studies on the subject should stimulate further research into the role of facilitation in the savanna ecosystem, particularly when analyzing the impact of past and projected climatic changes on it.},

abstract = {Analyses of fine-scale and macrogeographic genetic structure in plant populations provide an initial indication of how gene flow, natural selection, and genetic drift may collectively influence the distribution of genetic variation. The objective of our study is to evaluate the spatial dispersion of alleles within and among subpopulations of a tropical shrub, Psychotria officinalis (Rubiaceae), in a lowland wet forest in Costa Rica. This insect-pollinated, self-incompatible understory plant is dispersed primarily by birds, some species of which drop the seeds immediately while others transport seeds away from the parent plant. Thus, pollination should promote gene flow while at least one type of seed dispersal agent might restrict gene flow. Sampling from five subpopulations in undisturbed wet forest at Estacion Biologica La Selva, Costa Rica, we used electrophoretically detected isozyme markers to examine the spatial scale of genetic structure. Our goals are: 1) describe genetic diversity of each of the five subpopulations of Psychotria officinalis sampled within a contiguous wet tropical forest; 2) evaluate fine-scale genetic structure of adults of P. officinalis within a single 2.25-ha mapped plot; and 3) estimate genetic structure of P. officinalis using data from five subpopulations located up to 2 km apart. Using estimates of coancestry, statistical analyses reveal significant positive genetic correlations between individuals on a scale of 5 m but no significant genetic relatedness beyond that interplant distance within the studied subpopulation. Multilocus estimates of genetic differentiation among subpopulations were low, but significant (Fst = 0.095). Significant Fst estimates were largely attributable to a single locus (Lap-2). Thus, multilocus estimates of Fst may be influenced by microgeographic selection. If true, then the observed levels of IBD may be overestimates.},

abstract = {The distribution of saccate and nonsaccate pollen in modem conifers (nomenclature after Page 1990) shows a correlation with the method of pollen capture by the micropyle, although this has been little emphasized. Saccate pollen is restricted to, but not ubiquitous in, Phyllocladaceae, Pinaceae, and Podocarpaceae and is associated with the development of an inverted pollination drop, except in Phyllocladus. Saccate pollen is also nonwettable, in the sense that it floats on water, and it functions as a distinctive antigravity device. Pollen entry into the micropyle is dependent on resorption of the pollination drop and selectively excludes foreign particles. Nonsaccate pollen is wettable and sinks in water, but with two contrasted behaviors that discriminate two types of pollen reception. In Cephalotaxaceae, Cupressaceae, Sciadopityaceae, Taxaceae, and Taxodiaceae there is a pollination drop without preferred orientation. Pollen swells and bursts in water, shedding the exine by a mechanism determined by the apparently simple wall structure. In the remaining conifers with nonsaccate pollen-Agathis, Araucaria, i.e., Araucariaceae, together with Larix, Pseudotsuga, and Tsuga (Pinaceae) and Saxegothaea (Podocarpaceae)-there is no pollination drop, pollen is wettable but does not burst in water, and there is either extended siphonogamy or micropylar invagination. These observations show the adaptive features of pollen structure and ultrastructure. Despite their ubiquitous wind pollination, conifers thus have some diversity of pollination syndromes with reference to water and the introduction of pollen into the pollen chamber of the ovule, at which time pollination is complete.},

abstract = {The South Brazilian grasslands occupy some 13.7 million ha and support very high levels of biodiversity. This paper reviews the current state of ecological knowledge on South Brazilian Campos and of threats and challenges associated with their conservation. The principal factors shaping grassland physiognomy and diversity are discussed, and information is presented on diversity of plant species; best estimates suggest that 3000-4000 phanerophytes occur in the South Brazilian grasslands. It is argued that, despite their high species richness, Campos vegetation is not adequately protected under current conservation policies. In the past three decades, approximately 25{\%} of the grassland area has been lost due to land use changes, and this trend continues. However, representation of Campos grasslands in conservation units is extremely low (less than 0.5{\%}), and the management in most of these is inadequate to preserve the grasslands, as grazing and fire are important factors for their persistence. In conclusion, the following urgent needs are identified: (1) to create more conservation units in different regions, including different grassland types throughout southern Brazil, (2) to develop proper management strategies where grasslands are subject to shrub encroachment and forest expansion, (3) to conduct research on biodiversity and ecological processes in the Campos region and (4) to raise public awareness of the value and vulnerability of this vegetation type. {\textcopyright} 2007 R{\"{u}}bel Foundation, ETH Z{\"{u}}rich.},

Only 3{\%} of original Araucaria forests remain, which are generally confined to small forest fragments. Forest fragmentation can have serious consequences on genetic process in tree population, affecting long-term fitness and adaptability. To investigate the effects of forest fragmentation on genetic diversity and the structure of A. angustifolia populations, the genetic diversity of eight microsatellite loci was compared in four small fragmented populations ({\textless}22 ha), four tree groups (five to 11 trees) occurring in pastures and in three plots in a large continuous population. The clearest effect of fragmentation was the loss of rare alleles (p=0.05) in fragmented populations (19.4{\%} to 47.2{\%}) and intermediate frequency (0.05{\textless}p {\textless}= 0.25) and rare alleles (p=0.05) in tree groups (19{\%} to 86.1{\%}) in comparison to continuous populations. Fragmented populations have significant higher fixation index ((F) over cap (IS)=0.121, P{\textless}0.05) than continuous populations ({\textless}(F)over cap{\textgreater}(IS)=0.083, P{\textless}0.05).

Evidence that forest fragments have experienced a recent bottleneck was confirmed in at least two studied fragments. The implications of the results for conservation of the fragmented A. angustifolia populations are discussed.},

abstract = {Brazilian Caatinga is one of the most diverse dryland ecosystem of the world and is threatened by strong land use pressure and poor protection. In this study, we investigate the effects of past and present land use on plant community richness and structure. We used satellite information to identify 55 Caatinga forest plots with and without past vegetation clearing. We also quantified current land use, i.e. grazing by domestic animals, and selective logging. Caatinga vegetation structure, measured as vegetation cover, vegetation height, basal area and woody plant density, as well as recruitment, measured as woody plant seedling density and species richness, were negatively affected by both past and current land use. Past clear-cut not only had strong effects on most vegetation measures, but also increased current grazing which further negatively affected vegetation structure. Selective logging had little measurable effects but increased recruitment in plots previously clear-cut. Increasing time since the last clear-cut increased negative effects on vegetation, presumably because of a prolonged negative effect of grazing. Our results suggest that grazing needs to be prevented in areas degraded by clear-cut to allow vegetation restoration through natural succession and avoid further degradation and desertification.},

abstract = {Given the significance of animal dispersal to population dynamics and geographic variability, understanding how dispersal is impacted by landscape patterns has major ecological and conservation importance. Speaking to the importance of dispersal, the use of linear mixed models to compare genetic differentiation with pairwise resistance derived from landscape resistance surfaces has presented new opportunities to disentangle the menagerie of factors behind effective dispersal across a given landscape. Here, we combine these approaches with novel resistance surface parameterization to determine how the distribution of high- and low-quality seasonal habitat and individual landscape components shape patterns of gene flow for the greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) across Wyoming. We found that pairwise resistance derived from the distribution of low-quality nesting and winter, but not summer, seasonal habitat had the strongest correlation with genetic differentiation. Although the patterns were not as strong as with habitat distribution, multivariate models with sagebrush cover and landscape ruggedness or forest cover and ruggedness similarly had a much stronger fit with genetic differentiation than an undifferentiated landscape. In most cases, landscape resistance surfaces transformed with 17.33-km-diameter moving windows were preferred, suggesting small-scale differences in habitat were unimportant at this large spatial extent. Despite the emergence of these overall patterns, there were differences in the selection of top models depending on the model selection criteria, suggesting research into the most appropriate criteria for landscape genetics is required. Overall, our results highlight the importance of differences in seasonal habitat preferences to patterns of gene flow and suggest the combination of habitat suitability modeling and linear mixed models with our resistance parameterization is a powerful approach to discerning the effects of landscape on gene flow.},

Archeological research reveals that groups of pottery-producing hunter-gatherers belonging to the Je linguistic stock. These are archeologically defined as the Taquara/Itarare Tradition, and occupied the highlands in southern Brazil from 2000 years BP until 200 years BP. Major resource uses regarding forest vegetation were hunting, Araucaria nuts seed harvesting (considered an essential component in the diet) and agroforestry management. Their settlements, known as casas subterraneas (pit houses), were distributed according to relief and geography under the domain of Araucaria forest. A strong expansion of Araucaria angustifolia in the late Holocene is recorded by various palynological studies as occurring after 1,500 years BP in Parana, 1,000 years BP in Santa Catarina and 1,140 years BP in Rio Grande do Sul over areas near archaeological settlements. These data deserve some attention. Furthermore, botanical sources indicate that Araucaria angustifolia need a dispersing factor, including birds, animals and humans. In spite of climate conditions being considered one of the major causes of increase, the possibility of contribution by pottery-producing hunter-gatherers of the Taquara/Itarare Tradition in seed dispersal by harvesting of seeds, and possible management and planting of this species.

This species occurs in New Caledonia, a global biodiversity hotspot where the world's greatest concentration of endemic conifer species coincides with an extremely high level of habitat destruction due to fire and mining. Using seven microsatellite loci, estimates were made of genetic marker variation, inbreeding coefficients and population differentiation of adult and seedling cohorts of A. nemorosa. These were contrasted with equivalent estimates, made over similar spatial scales and with the same marker loci, in the locally common and more widespread sister species Araucaria columnaris. There were no significant differences in population genetic parameters between adult populations of the two species, despite their different abundances. However, in A. nemorosa, the juvenile cohort showed a loss of rare alleles and elevated levels of inbreeding when compared to the adult cohort. These genetic differences between the cohorts were not observed in the locally common A. columnaris. This suggests that recent environmental degradation is influencing the genetic structure of A. nemorosa populations. Although this is not detectable among predisturbance adult populations, an early warning of these impacts is evident in more recently established seedling cohorts. The conservation implications of these results are discussed.},

The monoecious African fig tree Ficus sycomorus L. relies on the small, short-lived, night-flying, host-specific fig wasp Ceratosolen arabicus Mayr for pollination. We used microsatellite markers to characterize a geographically isolated riparian population of F. sycomorus growing along the Ugab River in the Namib Desert, Namibia, together with paternity analysis of seedlings from known mothers, to map pollen movement within this population. In this way we tracked insect movements between individually recognizable trees by means of their pollen cargo and documented the movement of C. arabicus between known trees separated by more than 160 km, with a mean distance for confirmed successful pollination events of 88.6 km. The predominant observed movement of pollinators was in a westerly direction, toward the sea, reflecting seasonal nighttime wind direction and the wind-borne dispersal of fig wasps.

abstract = {New Caledonia is a global biodiversity hotspot. Hypotheses for its biotic richness suggest either that the island is a 'museum' for an old Gondwana biota or alternatively it has developed following relatively recent long distance dispersal and in situ radiation. The conifer genus Araucaria (Araucariaceae) comprises 19 species globally with 13 endemic to this island. With a typically Gondwanan distribution, Araucaria is particularly well suited to testing alternative biogeographic hypotheses concerning the origins of New Caledonian biota. We derived phylogenetic estimates using 11 plastid and rDNA ITS2 sequence data for a complete sampling of Araucaria (including multiple accessions of each of the 13 New Caledonian Araucaria species). In addition, we developed a dataset comprising 4 plastid regions for a wider taxon sample to facilitate fossil based molecular dating. Following statistical analyses to identify a credible and internally consistent set of fossil constraints, divergence times estimated using a Bayesian relaxed clock approach were contrasted with geological scenarios to explore the biogeographic history of Araucaria. The phylogenetic data resolve relationships within Araucariaceae and among the main lineages in Araucaria, but provide limited resolution within the monophyletic New Caledonian species group. Divergence time estimates suggest a Late Cretaceous-Cenozoic radiation of extant Araucaria and a Neogene radiation of the New Caledonian lineage. A molecular timescale for the evolution of Araucariaceae supports a relatively recent radiation, and suggests that earlier (pre-Cenozoic) fossil types assigned to Araucaria may have affinities elsewhere in Araucariaceae. While additional data will be required to adequately resolve relationships among the New Caledonian species, their recent origin is consistent with overwater dispersal following Eocene emersion of New Caledonia but is too old to support a single dispersal from Australia to Norfolk Island for the radiation of the Pacific Araucaria sect.

Many scientists have used the computer program CERVUS to estimate parentage, and have taken advantage of its option to allow for genotyping error. In this study, we show that the likelihood equations used by versions 1.0 and 2.0 of CERVUS to accommodate genotyping error miscalculate the probability of observing an erroneous genotype. Computer simulation and reanalysis of paternity in Rum red deer show that correcting this error increases success in paternity assignment, and that there is a clear benefit to accommodating genotyping errors when errors are present.

abstract = {Recent global land-use changes have led to reductions in many herbaceous plant species in semi-natural grassland landscapes. Changes in management frequency and intensity are known to cause declines in plant populations. However, little is known about the impact of changes in the timing of management practices on the genetic diversity as well as the reproductive success of rare semi-natural grassland species. We determined the suitable management (mowing) timing for Vincetoxicum pycnostelma Kitag. (Apocynaceae; Asclepiadoideae), an endangered summer- and autumn-blooming semi-natural grassland herb. We examined 15 V. pycnostelma populations to assess the effects of mowing timing on the genetic diversity of each population using nine microsatellite markers and on pollination and reproductive success. Pollination success was not affected by flowering timing. Mowing during the mid- to late flowering and fruiting periods of V. pycnostelma (July–September) had a significant negative effect on the number of inflorescences and total fruits produced, whereas mowing before flowering and growing periods (April, May and November–March) had positive effects on the number of inflorescences and fruits, respectively. Furthermore, mowing during the mid- to late flowering and fruiting periods also caused a significant decrease in genetic diversity. Our results demonstrated that mowing events during the mid- to late flowering and fruiting periods caused significant declines in the genetic diversity and/or reproductive success of V. pycnostelma. By contrast, mowing before flowering periods significantly enhanced reproductive success. To conserve semi-natural grassland herb diversity, mowing should be avoided during seasons when the flowering and fruiting periods of many endangered species overlap.},

abstract = {In this analysis, we attempt to understand how monoecy and dioecy drive spatial genetic structure (SGS) in plant populations. For this purpose, plants of the genus Ficus were used as a comparative model due to their particular characteristics, including high species diversity, variation in life histories, and sexual systems. One of the main issues we assessed is whether dioecious fig tree populations are more spatially genetically structured than monoecious populations. Using the Sp statistic, which allows for quantitative comparisons among different studies, we compared the extent of SGS between monoecious and dioecious Ficus species. To broaden our conclusions we used published data on an additional 27 monoecious and dioecious plant species. Furthermore, genetic diversity analyses were performed for two monoecious Ficus species using 12 microsatellite markers in order to strengthen our conclusions about SGS. Our results show that dioecy, more than monoecy, significantly contributes to SGS in plant populations. On average, the estimate of Sp was six times higher for dioecious Ficus species than monoecious Ficus species and it was two times higher in dioecious than monoecious plant species. Considering these results, we emphasize that the long-distance pollen dispersal mechanism in monoecious Ficus species seems to be the dominant factor in determining weak spatial genetic structure, high levels of genetic diversity, and lack of inbreeding. Although Ficus constitute a model species to study SGS, a more general comparison encompassing a wider range of plants is required in order to better understand how sexual systems affect genetic structure.},

abstract = {In order to determine the implications of including planted populations in conservation planning, we investigate the structure and genetic diversity, mating system, and effective population size within families in three planted and one natural Araucaria angustifolia populations. The study area is a Brazilian National Forest in southern Brazil, established in the 1950s. Genetic analysis was investigated using nine allozyme loci. Significant and positive fixation index was detected for the adults of all studied populations. Although we observed lower levels of genetic diversity and biparental inbreeding in some populations, their pattern of mating, similar to that expected in panmixia, indicates that all populations can be used in conservation planning. Furthermore, the presence of unique alleles and the significant genetic differentiation among all adult populations (F ST = 0.404) reinforces that all populations are important conservation resources. The average paternity correlation was high in almost all populations, showing that open-pollinated families are composed of mixtures of half- and full-sibs. With regards to conservation strategies, our results suggest that seed collection from at least 133 seed trees is necessary to retain a reference effective population size of 500. Our results confirm that the planted Araucaria forests in southern Brazil can be useful as a genetic resource for conservation, breeding and reforestation strategies for this threatened species. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {As the data resulting from modern genotyping tools are astoundingly complex, genotyping studies require great care in the sampling design, genotyping, data analysis and interpretation. Such care is necessary because, with data sets containing thousands of loci, small biases can easily become strongly significant patterns. Such biases may already be present in routine tasks that are present in almost every genotyping study. Here, I discuss seven common mistakes that can be frequently encountered in the genotyping literature: (i) giving more attention to genotyping than to sampling, (ii) failing to perform or report experimental randomization in the laboratory, (iii) equating geopolitical borders with biological borders, (iv) testing significance of clustering output, (v) misinterpreting Mantel's r statistic, (vi) only interpreting a single value of k and (vii) forgetting that only a small portion of the genome will be associated with climate. For every of those issues, I give some suggestions how to avoid the mistake. Overall, I argue that genotyping studies would benefit from establishing a more rigorous experimental design, involving proper sampling design, randomization and better distinction of a priori hypotheses and exploratory analyses.},

abstract = {In biome Pampa, Brazil, cattle farmers have managed the natural grasslands using practices that result in overgrazing, low productivity and low farm income. In addition, farmers in the region converted natural grasslands from beef production to more profitable activities, such as cash crops. This conversion and overgrazing have caused environmental problems in biome Pampa. Although several innovations that increase beef productivity without damaging the environment are currently available to farmers in the region, the adoption rate remains low. This study used the theory of planned behavior (TPB) to identify the beliefs that influence farmers' intention to use improved natural grassland. The TPB hypothesizes that adoption is driven by intention, which in turn is determined by three psychological constructs: attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control. These three constructs are derived from behavioral, normative and control beliefs, respectively. Results show that attitude had a strong impact on intention, followed by subjective norm and perceived behavioral control. Results also show that farmers' intention to use improved natural grassland depends on the extent to which farmers think this innovation allows for increasing the cattle density, the extent to which they think family and cattle traders support them in their decision to adopt and the extent to which farmers think they have sufficient knowledge and access to technical assistance.},

We evaluate genetic structure and diversity within and among 17 P. macrocephalus populations from 3 regions of southeastern Australia using 17 microsatellite markers developed de novo. Genetic structure was present in P. macrocephalusbetween the three regions but not at the population level. Environmental factors, namely temperature and precipitation, significantly explained differentiation between the North region and the other two regions indicating isolation by environment. Within regions, genetic structure currently shows a high level of gene flow and genetic variation. Our results suggest that within-region gene flow does not reflect current habitat fragmentation in southeastern Australia whereas temperature and precipitation are likely to be responsible for the differentiation detected among regions. Climate change may severely impact P. macrocephalus on the VVP and test its evolutionary resilience. We suggest taking a proactive conservation approach to improve long-term viability by sourcing material for restoration to assist gene flow to the VVP region to promote an increased adaptive capacity.},

Milder summer temperatures and vapour pressure deficits were measured under Araucaria and Baccharis compared with open grassland. There were also ameliorating effects on soil chemistry under individuals of these two species, but these were more pronounced for Araucaria than for Baccharis. The results suggest that the large number of seedlings commonly found beneath the canopy of Araucaria is due not only to perching, but also to nursing, through the amelioration of environmental conditions.},

To implement reasonable conservation, breeding and restorations program it is necessary to have the knowledge of pollen dispersal distance and fine-scale genetic structure. In this paper, levels and dispersion distance of pollen and spatial genetic structure of A.¬†angustifolia were investigated in a 14¬†ha transect in a continuous forest in Paran√° State, Brazil. Analyses have been performed by the use of eight microsatellite loci, paternity and TwoGener approaches, and spatial autocorrelation analysis. In transect, 52 male and 56 female adult trees were mapped and genotyped, together with 190 seeds. In the present transect, A.¬†angustifolia show spatial genetic structure at distances up to 75¬†m. Paternity analysis indicated that 54{\%} of seeds were fertilized by pollen from trees outside the transect. The calculated average pollination distance within transect was 102 and 98¬†m based on the paternity analysis and TwoGener analysis, respectively. We found a significant pollen gene pool structure across seed-trees ( Formula Not Shown , P¬†{\textless}¬†0.01) that corresponds to an effective number of pollen donors of 6.4 male trees or an effective pollination neighbourhood area (A ep ) of 2.1¬†ha. The findings suggest long-distance pollen dispersion ({\textgreater}100¬†m) inside the continuous forest. However, the high proportion occurs in short-distance producing biparental and correlated mating as well as reducing the variance effective size.},

abstract = {Seed dispersal sets the stage for the suite of biotic and abiotic interactions that determine the fate of individual seeds. In this review, we first focus on how dispersal influences the ‘seedscape', or the combination of abiotic and biotic factors that affect the probability of recruitment once a seed has reached its final location. We review recent papers that examine the effect of different dispersal vectors on (1) the quality of the habitat in which a seed lands; (2) the distance seeds are dispersed from the parent tree; and (3) the density and composition of plants within the neighborhood of a seed following deposition. Next, we explore methods used to scale these processes up to the level of populations. We highlight demographic models that integrate across multiple life history stages and predict the impact of dispersal in variable environments on population growth. We also review studies that analyze existing spatial patterns of trees within large forest plots and use various strategies to infer the processes that led to those patterns. We continue to scale up from populations to communities, and discuss approaches that have been taken to understand how dispersal may affect diversity and abundance in the community. We then turn to human disturbances and discuss the implications of frugivore defaunation for plant communities. We finish by highlighting several areas of research that are particularly promising for future directions of study.},

abstract = {Herbarium accession data offer a useful historical botanical perspective and have been used to track the spread of plant invasions through time and space. Nevertheless, few studies have utilised this resource for genetic analysis to reconstruct a more complete picture of historical invasion dynamics, including the occurrence of separate introduction events. In this study, we combined nuclear and chloroplast microsatellite analyses of contemporary and historical collections of Senecio madagascariensis, a globally invasive weed first introduced to Australia c. 1918 from its native South Africa. Analysis of nuclear microsatellites, together with temporal spread data and simulations of herbarium voucher sampling, revealed distinct introductions to south-eastern Australia and mid-eastern Australia. Genetic diversity of the south-eastern invasive population was lower than in the native range, but higher than in the mid-eastern invasion. In the invasive range, despite its low resolution, our chloroplast microsatellite data revealed the occurrence of new haplotypes over time, probably as the result of subsequent introduction(s) to Australia from the native range during the latter half of the 20th century. Our work demonstrates how molecular studies of contemporary and historical field collections can be combined to reconstruct a more complete picture of the invasion history of introduced taxa. Further, our study indicates that a survey of contemporary samples only (as undertaken for the majority of invasive species studies) would be insufficient to identify potential source populations and occurrence of multiple introductions.},

abstract = {The biennial plant Gentianella bohemica is a subendemic of the Bohemian Massif, where it occurs in seminatural grasslands. It has become rare in recent decades as a result of profound changes in land use. Using amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLP) fingerprint data, we investigated the genetic structure within and among populations of G. bohemica in Bavaria, the Czech Republic, and the Austrian border region. The aim of our study was (1) to analyze the genetic structure among populations and to discuss these findings in the context of present and historical patterns of connectivity and isolation of populations, (2) to analyze genetic structure among consecutive generations (cohorts of two consecutive years), and (3) to investigate relationships between intrapopulational diversity and effective population size (N(e)) as well as plant traits. (1) The German populations were strongly isolated from each other (pairwise F(ST)= 0.29-0.60) and from all other populations (F(ST)= 0.24-0.49). We found a pattern of near panmixis among the latter (F(ST)= 0.15-0.35) with geographical distance explaining only 8{\%} of the genetic variance. These results were congruent with a principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) and analysis using STRUCTURE to identify genetically coherent groups. These findings are in line with the strong physical barrier and historical constraints, resulting in separation of the German populations from the others. (2) We found pronounced genetic differences between consecutive cohorts of the German populations (pairwise F(ST)= 0.23 and 0.31), which can be explained by local population history (land use, disturbance). (3) Genetic diversity within populations (Shannon index, H(Sh)) was significantly correlated with N(e) (R(S)= 0.733) and reflected a loss of diversity due to several demographic bottlenecks. Overall, we found that the genetic structure in G. bohemica is strongly influenced by historical periods of high connectivity and isolation as well as by marked demographic fluctuations in declining populations.},

abstract = {In most tropical and subtropical biomes, conservation strategies are mainly focused on the preservation of forests. However, neotropical dry forest and savanna ecoregions include open habitats that may deserve conservation attention. We analyzed the historical patterns and potential distribution of natural grasslands, as well as their biodiversity in the northern Argentina dry Chaco, which is one of the largest and yet most rapidly transforming neotropical ecoregions. Paleocological literature, historical records, and bioclimatic modeling support the hypothesis that Chaco grasslands distribution was more extended in the past, and has been historically reduced by woody encroachment resulting from environmental changes occurred in the past century. Recent research shows that natural grasslands host distinctive components of the Chaco biodiversity, and a significant proportion of the vertebrate species have a negative association with woody biomass. Ongoing land use trends continue to threaten native grasslands both in unprotected sectors (where they are converted into agriculture and planted pastures) and inside protected areas (were fire suppression is favoring woody encroachment). Current conservation policies (Protected Areas, Argentine forest law, REDD+) neglect the importance of native grasslands for biodiversity conservation. Such forest-centered initiatives should be revised to specifically include native grasslands and their biodiversity into land use strategies that adequately balance agriculture and livestock production with biodiversity conservation.},

Local adaptation was investigated both by native superiority over non-natives, and by comparing the observed performance of a population to the fitted value of a reduced statistical model that showed the populations' performance at all sites and the performance of all other populations at its home site. The latter method indicates presence of local adaptation even when natives are inferior to introduced populations as long as the negative difference in fitness between the populations is smaller at the native population's home site. The strength of local adaptation was measured as the ratio of the observed to the expected performance in reduced statistical models and regressed on the degree of isolation and population size. We found no evidence of local adaptation in terms of native superiority compared to non-natives, but with the relative method we found one of six fitness components, juvenile survival, to be 6{\%} higher for natives at their home sites compared to how they performed at other sites and how others performed at their site. Further, our results indicate that both isolation and population size have a positive effect on the process of local adaptation.},

abstract = {The logging of large trees in tropical forests causes a decrease in the density of reproductive individ- uals, which likely affects the pattern of pollen dispersal and the mating system of the remaining trees in the pop- ulation. Here, we investigate the impact of logging on mating system and genetic diversity of the low-density, thrip-pollinated, dioecious tree Bagassa guianensis with- in a 500-ha plot at Tapaj{\'{o}}s National Forest, Par{\'{a}} State, Brazil. Mating system parameters of the logged popula- tion were estimated using mixed-mating model. Six mi- crosatellite loci were used to genotype 232 seeds from ten remnant female trees over three seasons (2006, 2007, and 2008). The data were compared with the mating system of the unlogged population of B. guianensis (18 female trees, 488 seeds) in the same plot. The overall number of alleles found in the open-pollinated progenies decreased after logging (K=71 before logging and K=57 after logging, considering the three after logging seasons pooled), as well as the average number of alleles per locus (A = 11.8 and 9.5, respectively). Similarly, the number of private alleles, which is defined in the context of this study as the number of alleles observed in the population exclusively before or after logging, also de- creased after logging (15 and 1, respectively). However, the average number of alleles per locus and the observed and expected heterozygosities were not significantly higher before logging than after logging. Logging Logging also did not affect the inbreeding of progenies in the popula- tion. Somewhat unexpectedly, the effective number of pollen donors was consistently higher after (Nep =14.5 in 2006, 8.1 in 2007, and 6.3 in 2008) than before log- ging (Nep = 3.4), suggesting that the loss of alleles in the population was compensated by the higher heterogeneity in the pollen pool after the removal of the largest trees by logging. Potential causes explaining the patterns found here include the maintenance of large patches of forest around the logged plot and the species' ability to perform long-distance pollination by airborne thrips. Maintenance of landscape integrity as logged and unlogged forests around the exploited areas is recom- mended to enhance pollen migration and to avoid long- term losses in genetic diversity},

The monoecious African fig tree Ficus sycomorus L. relies on the small, short-lived, night-flying, host-specific fig wasp Ceratosolen arabicus Mayr for pollination. We used microsatellite markers to characterize a geographically isolated riparian population of F. sycomorus growing along the Ugab River in the Namib Desert, Namibia, together with paternity analysis of seedlings from known mothers, to map pollen movement within this population. In this way we tracked insect movements between individually recognizable trees by means of their pollen cargo and documented the movement of C. arabicus between known trees separated by more than 160 km, with a mean distance for confirmed successful pollination events of 88.6 km. The predominant observed movement of pollinators was in a westerly direction, toward the sea, reflecting seasonal nighttime wind direction and the wind-borne dispersal of fig wasps. Our results suggest the existence of an extensive panmictic population of trees that are well suited to overcome the effects of geographical isolation.},

abstract = {Characteristics of tree species may uniquely situate them to withstand environmental changes. Paleoecological evidence indicates that the geographic ranges of tree species have expanded and contracted several times since the last glacial epoch in response to directional environmental changes. For most tree species, these range fluctuations have been accomplished without any apparent loss of genetic diversity. A possible explanation that distinguishes most trees from many herbaceous plants is that much of the genetic variation within tree species is found within rather than among their populations. Thus, the extinction of a relatively large proportion of a tree species' populations would result in relatively little overall loss of genetic diversity. Furthermore, phylogeographic studies indicate that for some tree species, habitat heterogeneity (elevation, slope aspect, moisture, etc.) in glacial refugia may have preserved adaptive genetic variation that, when recombined and exposed to selection in newly colonized habitats, gave rise to the local adaptation currently seen. The maintenance of genetic diversity in the face of extensive habitat fragmentation is also a concern. Many forest trees, however, may be buffered from the adverse effects of habitat fragmentation. First, the longevity of individual trees may retard population extinction and allow individuals and populations to survive until habitat recovery occurs. Second, considerable evidence is available that both animal and wind-pollinated tree species in fragments experience levels of pollen flow that are sufficient to counteract the effects of genetic drift. The combination of individual longevity, high intra-population genetic diversity and the potential for high rates of pollen flow should make tree species especially resistant to extinction and the loss of genetic diversity during changing environmental conditions. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Tropical agro-forest landscapes are global priority areas for biodiversity conservation. Little is known about the ability of these landscapes to sustain large late successional forest trees upon which much forest biodiversity depends. These landscapes are subject to fragmentation and additional habitat degradation which may limit tree recruitment and thus compromise numerous ecosystem services including carbon storage and timber production. Dysoxylum malabaricum is a large canopy tree species in the Meliaceae, a family including many important tropical timber trees. This species is found in highly fragmented forest patches within a complex agro-forest landscape of the Western Ghats biodiversity hot spot, South India. In this paper we combined a molecular assessment of inbreeding with ecological and demographic data to explore the multiple threats to recruitment of this tree species. An evaluation of inbreeding, using eleven microsatellite loci in 297 nursery-reared seedlings collected form low and high density forest patches embedded in an agro-forest matrix, shows that mating between related individuals in low density patches leads to reduced seedling performance. By quantifying habitat degradation and tree recruitment within these forest patches we show that increasing canopy openness and the increased abundance of pioneer tree species lead to a general decline in the suitability of forest patches for the recruitment of D. malabaricum. We conclude that elevated inbreeding due to reduced adult tree density coupled with increased degradation of forest patches, limit the recruitment of this rare late successional tree species. Management strategies which maintain canopy cover and enhance local densities of adult trees in agro-forest mosaics will be required to ensure D. malabaricum persists in these landscapes. Our study highlights the need for a holistic understanding of the incipient processes that threaten populations of many important and rare tropical tree species in human dominated agro-forest landscapes.},

abstract = {Tropical trees often display long-distance pollen dispersal, even in highly fragmented landscapes. Understanding how patterns of spatial isolation influence pollen dispersal and interact with background patterns of fine-scale spatial genetic structure (FSGS) is critical for evaluating the genetic consequences of habitat fragmentation. In the endangered tropical timber tree Dysoxylum malabaricum (Meliaceae), we apply eleven microsatellite markers with paternity and parentage analysis to directly estimate historic gene flow and contemporary pollen dispersal across a large area (216-�km2) in a highly fragmented agro-forest landscape. A comparison of genetic diversity and genetic structure in adult and juvenile life stages indicates an increase in differentiation and FSGS over time. Paternity analysis and parentage analysis demonstrate high genetic connectivity across the landscape by pollen dispersal. A comparison between mother trees in forest patches with low and high densities of adult trees shows that the frequency of short-distance mating increases, as does average kinship among mates in low-density stands. This indicates that there are potentially negative genetic consequences of low population density associated with forest fragmentation. Single isolated trees, in contrast, frequently receive heterogeneous pollen from distances exceeding 5-�km. We discuss the processes leading to the observed patterns of pollen dispersal and the implications of this for conservation management of D.-�malabaricum and tropical trees more generally},

abstract = {This study investigates patterns of genetic connectivity among 11 co-distributed tropical rainforest tree species from the genus Elaeocarpus across a biogeographic barrier, the Black Mountain Corridor (BMC) in the Australian Wet Tropics (AWT). We analysed a combination of allelic and flanking region sequence data from microsatellite markers, and evaluated the relative influence of environmental preferences and functional traits on genetic diversity and gene flow. The results indicate that only in three species geographic structuring of haplotype distribution reflects a north vs. south of the BMC pattern. Environmental factors linked with altitude were recognized as affecting genetic trends, but the selective processes operating on upland species appear to be associated with competitiveness and regeneration opportunities on poor soil types rather than climate variables alone. In contrast to previous observations within southeastern Australian rainforests, genetic differentiation in the AWT appears to be associated with small-fruited rather than large-fruited species, highlighting how external factors can influence the dispersal dimension. Overall, this study emphasizes the importance of considering functional and environmental factors when attempting generalizations on landscape-level patterns of genetic variation. Understanding how plant functional groups respond to environmental and climatic heterogeneity can help us predict responses to future change.},

Geospatial models were$\backslash$nconstructed of environmental domains for rain forest, savanna and$\backslash$ngrassland, and for areas of biome change. Grassland soils were analysed$\backslash$nfor carbon isotope ratios (delta C-13), and radiocarbon (C-14) dates$\backslash$nwere acquired for bulk samples from a range of depths.$\backslash$nResults Analysis revealed weak associations between topography and the$\backslash$ndistribution of rain forest, savanna and grassland, and their patterns$\backslash$nof recent change. Grassland occupied an environmental domain$\backslash$nintermediate between rain forest and savanna and was more than four$\backslash$ntimes as likely to occur within a matrix of rain forest rather than$\backslash$nsavanna. There was a large proportional reduction in the area of both$\backslash$ngrassland (-35{\%}) and savanna (-19{\%}) between 1961 and 2006 because of$\backslash$nthe expansion of rain forest. However, the greater initial extent of$\backslash$nsavanna meant that the areal loss of savanna was an order of magnitude$\backslash$ngreater than for grassland (1433 vs. 146 ha). There was no evidence of$\backslash$nabrupt changes in delta C-13 in grassland soil profiles, indicating$\backslash$nstability of the vegetation over the last 2000 years.$\backslash$nMain conclusions There is no simple gradient in `tree suitability' from$\backslash$nrain forest, through savanna, to treeless grassland on the Bunya$\backslash$nMountains. A general absence of fire since the 19th century has greatly$\backslash$nreduced the extent of grassy savanna and grassland formations, to the$\backslash$nadvantage of rain forest. These results support the hypothesis that the$\backslash$nvegetation mosaic on the Bunya Mountains is a cultural artefact and$\backslash$ntestament to millennia of skilful and persistent burning. We could not$\backslash$nconclusively reject the hypothesis that the grasslands are Pleistocene$\backslash$nrelicts that have declined throughout the Holocene; nonetheless, an$\backslash$nexplanation more consistent with the evidence overall is that the$\backslash$ngrasslands must have had periods of expansion during the Holocene,$\backslash$nprobably as a consequence of severe fires that have destroyed patches of$\backslash$nrain forest.},

abstract = {To investigate how accurately biparentage assignments for coniferous seeds can be improved by using different kinds of seed tissues, we assigned biparentage to dispersed seeds in a natural stand of Pinus densiflora Siebold {\&} Zucc. (288 mature trees) using two procedures: with or without megagametophyte haplotype data ("MH" and "ordinary" procedures, respectively). Using archived clones, we confirmed the conifer-specific modes of inheritance of three kinds of seed tissues from certain maternal trees using six microsatellite markers. In the natural stand, under the MH procedure, 39.2{\%} of male parents and 77.0{\%} of female parents for a total of 204 seeds analyzed were assigned to at least one mature tree within the study area. At that time, the proportion of exactly matching seeds out of seeds with one matching parent under the MH procedure was significantly larger than that of the seeds under the ordinary procedure. The biparentage assignments under the ordinary procedure corresponded to only 53.7{\%} of the accurate separate assignments under the MH procedure. It is suggested that analyzing different seed tissues is effective for exact and accurate biparentage assignments in investigations of biparentally mediated gene flow in coniferous populations, particularly at the seed-dispersal stage.},

abstract = {The phylogeographical history of mid-altitude woodland herbs that depend on moist and shaded forest habitats is poorly understood. Here, we analysed the genetic structure of Cyclamen purpurascens, a mountainous calcicolous perennial, to test hypotheses regarding its glacial survival in single or multiple refugia and postglacial colonization routes, and to explore how they are congruent with the histories inferred for temperate trees and other mountainous herbs. We gathered AFLP data and chloroplast DNA sequences (trnD-trnT region) from 68 populations spanning the entire distribution range (the Jura Mountains, Alps, western Carpathians, Dinarides). Both genetic markers revealed two main phylogeographical groups (phylogroups) in C. purpurascens. Additionally, AFLP data detected a more detailed structure of five phylogroups: two widespread, showing east−west geographical separation, and three local ones, restricted to somewhat disjunct, marginal regions of the species range. We suggest that C. purpurascens survived the last glaciation in two main regions, the foothills of the Southern Limestone Alps and the Karst area of the north-western Dinarides, and possibly also in microrefugia in the Western Carpathians. The glacial persistence and colonization routes of this woodland herb are highly concordant with those inferred for several temperate trees, especially the European beech. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2012, 105, 741–760.},

abstract = {The Wollemi pine (Wollemia nobilis) is a rare Southern conifer with striking morphological similarity to fossil pines. A small population of W. nobilis was discovered in 1994 in a remote canyon system in the Wollemi National Park (near Sydney, Australia). This population contains fewer than 100 individuals and is critically endangered. Previous genetic studies of the Wollemi pine have investigated its evolutionary relationship with other pines in the family Araucariaceae, and have suggested that the Wollemi pine genome contains little or no variation. However, these studies were performed prior to the widespread use of genome sequencing, and their conclusions were based on a limited fraction of the Wollemi pine genome. In this study, we address this problem by determining the entire sequence of the W. nobilis chloroplast genome. A detailed analysis of the structure of the genome is presented, and the evolution of the genome is inferred by comparison with the chloroplast sequences of other members of the Araucariaceae and the related family Podocarpaceae. Pairwise alignments of whole genome sequences, and the presence of unique pseudogenes, gene duplications and insertions in W. nobilis and Araucariaceae, indicate that the W. nobilis chloroplast genome is most similar to that of its sister taxon Agathis. However, the W. nobilis genome contains an unusually high number of repetitive sequences, and these could be used in future studies to investigate and conserve any remnant genetic diversity in the Wollemi pine.},

abstract = {Forty-one endemic conifer species occur on New Caledonia's ultramafic substrates (known locally as "terrains miniers"), the source of nickel ore deposits being exploited at a rapidly increasing rate. Impacts of the removal of native vegetation and its destruction by the deposition of mine wastes are compounded by fire, which has dramatically reduced and fragmented the original cover. A new threat evaluation of these conifers, now being incorporated into the IUCN Red List, is presented. A conservation action plan is proposed to ensure their long term survival. Four species are classified as Critically Endangered (CR), 13 Endangered (EN), 6 Vulnerable (VU), 7 Nearly Threatened (NT) and 11 Least Concern. Wetland habitats contain two threatened species (i.e., CR, EN or VU), all inadequately protected in a single reserve. High altitude forest and maquis (a characteristic scrub-like vegetation) have four threatened and three NT conifers only partially encompassed in protected areas, some open to mining. Thirteen threatened species are restricted to low- and mid-elevation forests, and another three that can also occur on non-ultramafic substrates have isolated, unprotected populations in small forest remnants. Fire and land clearing for mining threaten two conifer species in low- to mid-elevation maquis along with subpopulations of five primarily forest species. Conserving the threatened conifers on terrains miniers will require coordinated measures including: comprehensive protection of forest remnants by forbidding mine waste stockpiling; establishment of new reserves, especially in key unprotected massifs; effective fire prevention; restoration of forest corridors between forest remnants; and multiplication/transplanting of selected species.},

abstract = {Changes in local population size are expected to have an effect on the degree of genetic microdifferentiation. A decrease in population size is expected to lead to an increase in microdifferentiation, and an increase in population size to a decrease in microdifferentiation. These expectations are routinely used with historical and/or demographic data to evaluate changes in estimates of microdifferentiation obtained over time for human populations. Here I look more closely at these expectations by using simple mathematical models that relate a change in average effective population size to the degree of microdifferentiation. The direction of change in microdifferentiation is influenced by the migration structure of the populations and the proximity of the region to an equilibrium state. A change in population size always leads to a new equilibrium, but the speed at which this new equilibrium is reached depends on migration and time depth. A decline in population size in one generation always leads to an immediate increase in the degree of microdifferentiation. An increase in population size in one generation could lead to an initial decrease or increase in the degree of microdifferentiation or to no change at all. Consideration of the parameters of the models shows under what conditions such changes occur. The relevance of these models is explored using summary data from a number of human populations.},

abstract = {Interest in using native grass species for restoration is increasing, yet little is known about the ecology and genetics of native grass populations or the spatial scales over which seed can be transferred and successfully grown. The purpose of this study was to investigate the genetic structure within and among populations of Elymus glaucus in order to make some preliminary recommendations for the transfer and use of this species in revegetation and restoration projects. Twenty populations from California, Oregon, and Washington were analyzed for allozyme genotype at 20 loci, and patterns of variation within and among populations were determined. Allozyme variation at the species level was high, with 80{\%} of the loci polymorphic and an average expected heterozygosity (an index of genetic diversity) of 0.194. All but two of the populations showed some level of polymorphism. A high degree of population differentiation was found, with 54.9{\%} of the variation at allozyme loci partitioned among populations (F-st = 0.549). A lesser degree of genetic differentiation among closely spaced subpopulations within one of the populations was also demonstrated (F-st = 0.124). Self-pollination and the patchy natural distribution of the species both likely contribute to the low level of gene flow (Nm = 0.205) that was estimated. Zones developed for the transfer of seed of commercial conifer species may be inappropriate for transfer of E. glaucus germplasm because conifer species are characterized by high levels of gene flow. Limited gene flow in E. glaucus can facilitate the divergence of populations over relatively small spatial scales. This genetic differentiation can be due to random genetic drift, localized selective pressures, or both. In order to minimize the chances of planting poorly adapted germplasm, seed of E. glaucus may need to be collected in close proximity to the proposed restoration site.},

abstract = {Forest restoration programmes aim to use material for re-planting that is genetically diverse and not inbred. However, restricted seed sampling, high variance in reproductive output, and the production of inbred seeds that survive in the nursery but not in the wild can lead to forest restoration stock being genetically compromised. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the reproductive biology of the New Caledonian endemic conifer Araucaria nemorosa makes it susceptible to these genetic problems and to assess whether there is evidence for genetic bottlenecks and elevated inbreeding in nursery stock compared to seedlings and adults from wild source populations. Reproductive output was low with high variance among trees (only 14{\%} of adult trees surveyed produced mature cones, {\textgreater}50{\%} of examined cones had {\textless}10 viable seeds). Evidence for an extreme genetic bottleneck was detected in a nursery population established from cones collected from adult trees. A second nursery population established with seed collected from the forest floor showed no evidence of a genetic bottleneck, but was inbred compared to its wild source population. In light of these results, we do not recommend collecting cones directly from A. nemorosa as an efficient means of establishing genetically diverse stock for restoration programmes. Collecting seed from the forest floor is likely to be more effective, but the planting stock may contain a high proportion of inbred individuals. Collecting established wild seedlings already subjected to natural selection is suggested as an alternative method of maximising the diversity captured, whilst minimising sampling effort and proportion of inbred individuals. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Despite their narrow distribution, Australian rainforests still contain considerable levels of diversity and include many ancient, but often rare, lineages. Very little is known about the general biology of rainforest species, yet their long-term management depends on a better understanding of the main factors leading to rarity. For instance, are they highly endemic taxa, at the early stages of expansion, nearing the end of a period of decline, or persisting at low numbers over the long term? In this study we combine molecular, environmental, and ecological data to identify the factors responsible for the narrow distribution of a paleoendemic rainforest tree: Elaeocarpus sedentarius (Elaeocarpaceae). Between-population and between-generation comparisons of genetic diversity across all known populations of E. sedentarius show evidence of mutation-drift equilibrium rather than evidence of a recent bottleneck. Similarly, floristic and environmental data negate the hypothesis of rarity as a consequence of highly specialized habitat requirements. Instead, genetic structure and the available ecological data support the hypothesis of dispersal limitation as the main cause of endemism and that the species may have attained genetic equilibrium without realizing its full niche potential. We suggest that these factors are likely to explain narrow endemism in a broader range of taxa.},

Paternity analysis using six microsatellite loci identified a pollen source for 45{\%} of seedlings, and the remainder were assumed to have arisen from pollen sources outside the stands. Outcrossing was variable, ranging from 52 to 89{\%}, and long distance pollen dispersal was observed in all populations with up to 65{\%} of pollen sourced from outside the populations over distances of at least 1 km. Modelling dispersal functions for pollination events within the two larger populations showed little difference between the four two-parameter models tested and indicated a fat-tailed dispersal curve. Similarity of direct and indirect historical estimates of gene flow indicates maintenance of gene flow at levels experienced prior to fragmentation. The study revealed extensive long distance pollen dispersal in remnant patches of trees within a fragmented agricultural landscape in the southern temperate region and highlighted the role of remnant patches in maintaining genetic connectivity at the landscape scale.},

However, AGF may cause outbreed-ing depression (especially if source and recipient populations have been long isolated) and may disrupt local adaptation to nonclimatic factors. Selection should eliminate extrinsic outbreeding depression due to adaptive differences in large populations, and simulations suggest that, within a few generations, evolution should resolve mild intrinsic outbreeding depression due to epista-sis. To weigh the risks of AGF against those of maladaptation due to climate change, we need to know the species' extent of local adaptation to climate and other environmental factors, as well as its pattern of gene flow. AGF should be a powerful tool for managing foundation and resource-producing species with large populations and broad ranges that show signs of historical adaptation to local climatic conditions.},

abstract = {Over the past century, the Brazilian Atlantic forest has been reduced to small, isolated fragments of forest. Reproductive isolation theories predict a loss of genetic diversity and increases in inbreeding and spatial genetic structure (SGS) in such populations. We analysed eight microsatellite loci to investigate the pollen and seed dispersal patterns, genetic diversity, inbreeding and SGS of the tropical tree Copaifera langsdorffii in a small (4.8 ha), isolated population. All 112 adult trees and 128 seedlings found in the stand were sampled, mapped and genotyped. Seedlings had signifi-cantly lower levels of genetic diversity (A ¼ 16.5 ± 0.45, mean±95{\%} s.e.; H e ¼ 0.838±0.006) than did adult trees (A ¼ 23.2±0.81; H e ¼ 0.893±0.030). Parentage analysis did not indicate any seed immigration (m seeds ¼ 0) and the pollen immigration rate was very low (m pollen ¼ 0.047). The average distance of realized pollen dispersal within the stand was 94 m, with 81{\%} of the pollen travelling o150 m. A significant negative correlation was found between the frequency and distance of pollen dispersal (r ¼ {\`{A}}0.79, Po0.01), indicating that short-distance pollinations were more frequent. A significant SGS for both adults (B50 m) and seedlings (B20 m) was also found, indicating that most of the seeds were dispersed over short distances. The results suggested that the spatial isolation of populations by habitat fragmentation can restrict seed and pollen gene flow, increase SGS and affect the genetic diversity of future generations.},

abstract = {We investigated the richness, density, and composition of woody-tree species, and which traits of colonizing species are selected in commercial stands of Pinus elliottii and Araucaria angustifolia in southern Brazil. Analyses of variance with permutation tests were performed to assess differences among stand types in relation to density and rarefied richness. Multivariate analyses of variance with permutation tests were performed to compare stand types in relation to species composition and reproductive traits. Native forests presented higher stem density when compared to the plantations, while species richness did not vary among stand types. Species composition differed between the native forest and the plantations. Species' reproductive traits differed between the two types of plantations. The higher frequency of zoochorous diaspores in P. elliottii plantations when compared to the other stand types suggests the importance of the fauna in creating and sustaining the understory structure in this type of plantation. Plantations show a high potential as colonization sites by native woody species, despite their structural differences in relation to native forests. If properly managed, plantations might be catalysts for the recovery of degraded areas. {\textcopyright} 2014 Associa{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o Brasileira de Ci{\^{e}}ncia Ecol{\'{o}}gica e Conserva{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o.

Like many grasslands around the world, the Campos grasslands are declining with few conservation efforts underway. In contrast, forests receive much attention and many incentives. It is hypothesized that perception of land cover has the potential to shape ecosystems. Here we conduct a questionnaire to further our understanding of decision-making practices that alter landscapes (Campos grassland, Araucaria forest, agriculture and plantation) and direct land policies in the region. Our analysis reveals that plantations are significantly less desirable than the other landscape types. However, plantation land use has increased by 87 {\%} over the past few decades, as a result of industry and government incentives. The proportions of other landscape types have remained consistent over the past two decades. Restoration of native vegetation is not a priority of landowners and restoration would require a financial incentive. {\textcopyright} 2015, The Author(s).},

abstract = {Abstract Questions: Do small rocky outcrops favor forest plant colonization and establishment in grasslands? If so, what are the potential mechanisms involved in this process? Location: Araucaria forest and Campos grassland mosaic in southern Brazilian highlands (2929S, 5012W). Methods: We collected data on the density of forest woody species in plots located on rocky outcrops and in open fields subject to different management regimes. We evaluated the influence of outcrops on the density of forest plants 60-cm tall, and the effects of other environmental variables and of site on plant density; we also used information on diaspore traits of the species to discuss the way in which plants disperse to the outcrops. Results: Rocky outcrops harbored a significantly higher density of forest plants than open fields, irrespective of site effect, and rock height was the best predictor for plant density on outcrops. Diaspores of all recorded species possess characteristics associated with dispersal by birds or mammals or by both. Conclusions: Small rocky outcrops markedly influence forest expansion by acting as perches for vertebrate dispersers and as nurse objects and safe sites for plants. Forest expansion starting in small outcrops possibly occurs as follows: perching of dispersers and increase of seed rain on rocks, promotion of better conditions of establishment for forest plants by nurse rocks, protection of plants sensitive to grazing and fire, and nucleation of forest vegetation.},

Abstract Distance and discrete geographic barriers play a role in isolating populations, as seed and pollen dispersal become limited. Nearby populations without any geo-graphic barrier between them may also suffer from ecological isolation driven by habitat heterogeneity, which may promote divergence by local adaptation and drift. Likewise, elevation gradients may influence the genetic structure and diversity of populations, particularly those marginally distributed. Bathysa aus-tralis (Rubiaceae) is a widespread tree along the elevation gradient of the Serra do Mar, SE Brazil. This self-compatible species is pollinated by bees and wasps and has autochoric seeds, suggesting restricted gene dispersal. We investigated the distribution of genetic diversity in six B. australis populations at two extreme sites along an elevation gradient: a lowland site (80–216 m) and an upland site (1010–1100 m.a.s.l.). Nine microsatellite loci were used to test for genetic structure and to verify differences in genetic diversity between sites. We found a marked genetic structure on a scale as small as 6 km (F ST = 0.21), and two distinct clusters were identified, each corresponding to a site. Although B. australis is continuously distributed along the elevation gradient, we have not observed a gene flow between the extreme populations. This might be related to B. australis biological features and creates a potential scenario for adaptation to the different conditions imposed by the elevation gradient. We failed to find an isolation-by-distance pattern; although on the fine scale, all populations showed spatial autocorrelation until {\~{}}10-20 m. Elevation difference was a relevant factor though, but we need further sampling effort to check its correlation with genetic distance. The lowland populations had a higher allelic richness and showed higher rare allele counts than the upland ones. The upland site may be more selective, eliminating rare alleles, as we did not find any evi-dence for bottleneck.},

abstract = {The Myrtaceae is a large family that includes about 3.000 species distributed by over 100 genera (Heywood, 1993; Paiva, 1997). Most species are concentrated in the South hemisphere, specially in tropical and subtropical regions of Australia, South and Central America and Southeast Asia (Heywood, 1993). A few species can be found in Southern Europe and North Africa, surrounding the Mediterranean sea. Eugenia and Eucalyptus are the genera including the highest number of species, whereas Myrtus communis is the only species native to Europe. Some species of Eucalyptus (e.g. E. citriodora, E. globulus) were introduced in several regions of Europe (Paiva, 1997). Meanwhile, they became the dominant species in some areas of Portugal and Spain (Mcvaugh, 1963).},

abstract = {Geographically isolated and small populations outside a species' central distribution range are likely to be of major importance to a species' ability to quickly adjust its distribution range to global change dynamics. Gene flow from the outside plays a pivotal role in the fate of these marginal populations. It has been proposed that spatial fragmentation and perceived geographic isolation do not necessarily reflect a loss of genetic connectivity in tree species. However, the spatial limits of long-distance gene flow, as well as its magnitude and impact, are still generally unknown. In the present study, we analyzed long-distance pollen-mediated gene flow into an isolated relict stand consisting of 7 individuals of Quercus robur L. based on a total sample of 177 trees and 9 microsatellite loci. We show that pollen-mediated gene flow across more than 80 km in this wind-pollinated tree species contributed at least 35{\%} of all successful pollinations in the investigated isolated and small oak stand at the eastern limit of the species' distribution. The observed pollen immigration shaped the genetic diversity of acorn progenies in the stand and might explain the comparably high genetic diversity in the persisting adult population.},

abstract = {Paternity analysis based on eight microsatellite loci was used to investigate pollen and seed dispersal patterns of the dioecious wind-pollinated tree, Araucaria angustifolia. The study sites were a 5.4 ha isolated forest fragment and a small tree group situated 1.7 km away, located in Paranalpha State, Brazil. In the forest fragment, 121 males, 99 females, 66 seedlings and 92 juveniles were mapped and genotyped, together with 210 seeds. In the tree group, nine male and two female adults were mapped and genotyped, together with 20 seeds. Paternity analysis within the forest fragment indicated that at least 4{\%} of the seeds, 3{\%} of the seedlings and 7{\%} of the juveniles were fertilized by pollen from trees in the adjacent group, and 6{\%} of the seeds were fertilized by pollen from trees outside these stands. The average pollination distance within the forest fragment was 83 m; when the tree group was included the pollination distance was 2006 m. The average number of effective pollen donors was estimated as 12.6. Mother-trees within the fragment could be assigned to all seedlings and juveniles, suggesting an absence of seed immigration. The distance of seedlings and juveniles from their assigned mother-trees ranged from 0.35 to 291 m (with an average of 83 m). Significant spatial genetic structure among adult trees, seedlings, and juveniles was detected up to 50 m, indicating seed dispersal over a short distance. The effective pollination neighborhood ranged from 0.4 to 3.3 ha. The results suggest that seed dispersal is restricted but that there is long-distance pollen dispersal between the forest fragment and the tree group; thus, the two stands of trees are not isolated.},

abstract = {The Siberian stone pine (Pinus sibirica Du Tour) is one of the main forest-forming coniferous species of the boreal ecosystems of Western Siberia. We used the isozyme method to analyze 11 ecotypes representing the latitudinal and longitudinal profiles within the species range, including samples from the geographic boundaries of the distribution. The genetic structure of the ecotypes is described on the basis of the variability for 26 isozyme loci encoding for 16 enzyme systems. The greatest genetic diversity was observed in the taiga ecotypes in the central part of the studied area, while the ecotypes along the species range boundaries were shown to be genetically depauperized. Approximately 8.1 {\%} of the observed genetic diversity is attributed to differences between the studied ecotypes. We detected high levels of genetic diversity for the Fest-2, Pgm-1, Sod-4, and a few other loci, as well as a correlation between allele frequencies and geographical locations of the populations. The results of multivariate analysis of allelic frequencies as well as cluster analysis allowed us to discriminate three major groups of ecotypes: north-eastern, central and south-western. In view of our results, we compare two hypotheses: one which attributes the spatial distribution of genetic variations to the selectivity for some of the polymorphic allozyme loci, and the other based in the history of the formation of the range of the Siberian stone pine. 2014 Pleiades Publishing, Inc.},

abstract = {The vegetation in the southern Brazilian highlands is characterized by Araucaria forest and Campos grassland. Evidences indicate that Araucaria forest is currently expanding over grassland and that this expansion may occur by nucleation or edge dynamics. Nucleation mechanisms of Araucaria forest expansion are well documented, whereas mechanisms of expansion starting from the forest edge are not. In this study, we aimed (1) to assess how prominent is Araucaria forest expansion over Campos grassland starting from the forest edge, and (2) to discuss about the possible mechanisms underlying sapling community colonization in grassland. We conducted our sampling in 11 transects disposed from the forest edge towards the grassland. The transects were distributed in four study sites. Each transect was 50 m long and was divided into 25 plots with area of 8 m. All forest woody sapling individuals were identified and registered. We considered distance from forest edge, presence of dead shrubs, Baccharis uncinella cover, nurse tree cover and rock cover as predictors of forest plant abundance and composition. Niche and distance contribution on the explanation of sapling composition and abundance were partitioned using, respectively, canonical correspondence analysis and multiple regressions. Cover of nurse trees explained almost 31{\%} of total variation in sapling abundance, followed by the distance from the forest edge that explained 6.9{\%}. Site explained 7.6{\%} of total variation in sapling species composition, followed by distance from the forest edge, which explained 2.3{\%}, whereas niche had a minor (2.1{\%}) and non-significant proportion of variation explanation. Our findings show that Araucaria forest expansion over native grasslands in southern Brazil relies deeply on the nurse plant effect. Previous studies have demonstrated that Araucaria forest forms nuclei scattered in the grassland where nurse plants or nurse rocks are established. Here, we bring evidences that nurse plants are important also to the tree encroachment starting closer to the forest edge. This study provides new information on the mechanisms involved in the forest expansion over native grasslands.},

abstract = {Pollen flow is a key biological process that connects plant populations, preventing genetic impoverishment and inbreeding. Pollen-mediated long-distance dispersal (LDD) events are especially important for plant species in increasingly fragmented landscapes. Patterns of pollen dispersal were directly estimated and dispersal kernels modelled in an experimental population of Ranunculus bulbosus and Trifolium montanum to determine the potential for LDD. Eight and 11 microsatellite markers were used for R. bulbosus and T. montanum, respectively, to run a likelihood-based paternity analysis on randomly chosen offspring (Ntotal = 180 per species) from five maternal plants. High rates of selfing were found in R. bulbosus (average 45.7{\%}), while no selfing was observed in T. montanum. The majority (60{\%}) of mating events occurred at very short distances: the median of the observed dispersal distances was 0.8 m in both species, and the average distances were 15.9 and 10.3 m in R. bulbosus and T. montanum, respectively. Modelling the pollen dispersal kernel with four different distribution functions (exponential-power, geometric, 2Dt and Weibull) indicated that the best fit for both species was given by a Weibull function. Yet, the tail of the T. montanum pollen dispersal kernel was thinner than in R. bulbosus, suggesting that the probability for LDD is higher in the latter species. Even though the majority of pollen dispersal occurred across short distances, the detection of several mating events up to 362 m (R. bulbosus) and 324 m (T. montanum) suggests that pollen flow may be sufficient to ensure population connectivity in these herb species across fragmented grasslands in Swiss agricultural landscapes.},

abstract = {Questions: 1. Do the species composition, richness and diversity of sapling communities vary significantly in differently sized patches? 2. Do forest patches of different sizes differ in woody plant colonization patterns? Location: Sa?o Francisco de Paula, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, 29°28' S, 50°13' W. Methods: Three woody vegetation types, differing in structural development (patch size) and recovering for 10 years from cattle and burning disturbances, were sampled on grassland. We analysed the composition and complexity of the woody sapling communities, through relative abundance, richness and diversity patterns. We also evaluated recruitment status (residents vs. colonizers) of species in communities occurring in different forest patch size classes. Results: 1. There is a compositional gradient in sapling communities strongly associated with forest patch area. 2. Richness and diversity are positively correlated to patch area, but only in poorly structured patches; large patches present richness and diversity values similar to small patches. 3. Resident to colonizer abundance ratio increases from nurse plants to large patches. The species number proportion between residents and colonizers is similar in small and large patches and did not differ between these patch types. 4. Large patches presented a high number of exclusive species, while nurse plants and small patches did not. Conclusions: Woody plant communities in Araucaria forest patches are associated with patch structure development. Richness and diversity patterns are linked to patch colonization patterns. Generalist species colonize the understorey of nurse plants and small patches; resident species cannot recruit many new individuals. In large patches, sapling recruitment by resident adults precludes the immigration of new species into the patches, limiting richness and diversity. {\textcopyright} IAVS; Opulus Press.},

abstract = {Climate is one of the most important drivers of local adaptation in forest tree species. Standing levels of genetic diversity and structure within and among natural populations of forest trees are determined by the interplay between climatic heterogeneity and the balance between selection and gene flow. To investigate this interplay, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped in 24 to 37 populations from four subalpine conifers, Abies alba Mill., Larix decidua Mill., Pinus cembra L. and Pinus mugo Turra, across their natural ranges in the Italian Alps and Apennines. Patterns of population structure were apparent using a Bayesian clustering program, STRUCTURE, which identified three to five genetic groups per species. Geographical correlates with these patterns, however, were only apparent for P. cembra. Multivariate environmental variables [i.e. principal components (PCs)] were subsequently tested for association with SNPs using a Bayesian generalized linear mixed model. The majority of the SNPs, ranging from six in L. decidua to 18 in P. mugo, were associated with PC1, corresponding to winter precipitation and seasonal minimum temperature. In A. alba, four SNPs were associated with PC2, corresponding to the seasonal minimum temperature. Functional annotation of those genes with the orthologs in Arabidopsis revealed several genes involved in abiotic stress response. This study provides a detailed assessment of population structure and its association with environment and geography in four coniferous species in the Italian mountains.},

abstract = {Australia's natural temperate grasslands have diminished to 0.5 {\%} of their former area since European settlement and, as a consequence, are highly fragmented and modified. Many vertebrate species that live in temperate grasslands are habitat specialists and therefore are at risk of decline through habitat loss and fragmentation. The grassland earless dragon (Tympanocryptis pinguicolla) is one such species. Once widespread, T. pinguicolla is now restricted to two general locations; the first is near Canberra in the Australian Capital Territory (including some adjacent land near Queanbeyan), and the second is the Monaro Tablelands in New South Wales. Here, we use microsatellite DNA data collected from the largest remaining populations near Canberra to examine genetic structure in this species in the context of the rapidly expanding urban landscape in this region. Our study revealed that, despite separation by only relatively small distances (largest distance similar to 13 km), the T. pinguicolla populations are highly genetically structured with little admixture. Our analyses also revealed that the population with the largest census size, but which has recently crashed in population size, exhibited little detectable gene flow to other populations and is essentially isolated. Our data indicate that significant barriers to dispersal exist among the remaining T. pinguicolla populations and that management of this species cannot rely on natural dispersal to bolster declining populations. Many different agencies and landholders are responsible for the protection of these remnant populations and a co-ordinated effort is required to provide reasonable confidence that the species will persist.},

Inbreeding, SGS and realized patterns of pollen and seed dispersal of the dioecious, wind pollinated Araucaria angustifolia were investigated based on microsatellite loci. The study was conducted in a 7.2 ha plot established within a continuous Araucaria Forest in Southern Brazil. In the plot, all 290 adult trees were mapped, measured (diameter at breast height, dbh), sexed, sampled and genotyped. We also sampled, measured (total height), mapped and genotyped 223 juveniles. A total of 86 alleles were detected in the sample (n = 513). Adults and juveniles showed a positive and significant fixation index (minimum of 0.096), suggesting inbreeding or Wahlund effect. Juveniles presented a significant aggregated distribution which was associated with a genetic aggregation (significant SGS up to 20 m), indicating that near neighbor trees may be related due the limited seed dispersal. However, the intensity of SGS was not significantly higher among juveniles (Sp = 0.0041) than adults (Sp = 0.0026). Realized pollen and seed immigration into the plot was low (pollen = 6 {\%}; seeds = 5 {\%}) and the patterns of pollen and seed dispersal were similar. Pollen was dispersed over long distances (343 m), but 50 {\%} was dispersed up to 124 m. Seeds also reached long distances (318 m), with 50 {\%} being dispersed up to 133 m.

In a Bayesian analysis, microsatellite data suggested population structure at two levels: at K= 2 and at K= 3 in agreement to the geographical distribution of populations. This result was confirmed by the UPGMA dendrogram based on microsatellite data (bootstrap support {\textgreater} 95{\%}). Non-hierarchical AMOVA revealed high variation among populations from different a posteriori defined geographical groups. The genetic distance between sample locations increased with geographical distance for microsatellites (r = 0.62; p = 0.003) and AFLPs (r= 0.32; p = 0.09). This pattern of population differentiation may be correlated with population history such as geographical isolation and postglacial colonization of highlands. implications of the population genetic structure for the conservation of genetic resources are discussed.},

abstract = {AimsIn situ species survival involves persistence at current sites and/or colonization of new locations. Determining the likelihood of these events requires an understanding of population dynamics and dispersal. We address these issues in populations of a critically endangered tropical conifer Araucaria nemorosa and provide conservation recommendations. Location Port Boise, island of Grand Terre, New Caledonia, Pacific Ocean. Methods We characterize the demographic structure of six populations of A. nemorosa based upon size class frequencies and relative basal area compared to competing angiosperm trees. Using genotype data from 280 adult individuals at seven microsatellite loci, we indirectly estimate dispersal distances and project a maximal dispersal envelope around the extant populations. Results Our survey detected marked differences in demographic parameters including the proportion of basal area occupied by A. nemorosa versus angiosperm trees (ranging from 25{\%} to 77{\%}), the size class frequency distributions of A. nemorosa and seedling densities (ranging from 500 to 37300 seedlings ha−1) among some populations. Wright's genetic neighbourhood ranged from 22 to 876 trees, and historic gene dispersal ranged from 10.8 to 82.4 m, indicating that most seed dispersal is {\textless}100 m. Main conclusions This study indicates that the risk of recruitment failure in remnant populations of Araucaria nemorosa is low in most of the stands but is high in the inland population For{\^{e}}t Nord. In situ natural regeneration appears to be constrained in this population, most likely as a consequence of competitive exclusion. Our results also suggest that the majority of seed dispersal is too short to allow A. nemorosa to disperse to new more hospitable sites within an ecologically relevant time-scale. Our findings have implications not only for this emblematic tree species but also for a wide range of fragmented and degraded plant species populations with limited dispersal that are vulnerable to competitive exclusion.},

abstract = {The conservation of genetic resources is a prerequisite for the maintenance of long-lived forest species. Araucaria araucana (Mol.) K. Koch is one of the oldest conifers in South America and a representative symbol of Chilean forest due to its endemicity and longevity. The aim of this study was to evaluate the genetic structure of the current A. araucana populations in Chile, to verify the possible genetic divergence between Coastal and Andean populations and to assess whether bottleneck events have influenced habitat fragmentation and threaten the genetic resources and evolutionary potential of the species. Twelve natural populations, nine from the Andes Cordillera and three from the Coast Cordillera were analysed by means of eight genomic microsatellite markers developed in A. araucana. Results of analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) highlighted significant differentiation between Coastal and Andean populations (16 {\%}; P = 0.004), detecting one significant barrier that separated populations from both Cordilleras as maximally differentiated areas. At local scale, both ranges revealed significant inter-population differentiation, with higher values for Coastal populations compared with Andean populations. These results suggested the presence of four gene pools (three in the Andes and one in the Coast Cordilleras) and one population (VIL) in the Coast Cordillera that differed to the rest. The differentiation between the Andean and Coastal populations may provide important baseline data that should allow further studies of landscape genetics in the species and that can contribute to develop conservation strategies for its genetic resources.},

abstract = {While African leopard populations are considered to be continuous as demon- strated by their high genetic variation, the southernmost leopard population exists in the Eastern and Western Cape, South Africa, where anthropogenic activities may be affecting this population's structure. Little is known about the elusive, last free-roaming top predator in the region and this study is the first to report on leopard population structuring using nuclear DNA. By analyzing 14 microsatellite markers from 40 leopard tissue samples, we aimed to under- stand the populations' structure, genetic distance, and gene flow (Nm). Our results, based on spatially explicit analysis with Bayesian methods, indicate that leopards in the region exist in a fragmented population structure with lower than expected genetic diversity. Three population groups were identified, between which low to moderate levels of gene flow were observed (Nm 0.5 to 3.6). One subpopulation exhibited low genetic differentiation, suggesting a con- tinuous population structure, while the remaining two appear to be less con- nected, with low emigration and immigration between these populations. Therefore, genetic barriers are present between the subpopulations, and while leopards in the study region may function as a metapopulation, anthropogenic activities threaten to decrease habitat and movement further. Our results indi- cate that the leopard population may become isolated within a few generations and suggest that management actions should aim to increase habitat connectiv- ity and reduce human–carnivore conflict. Understanding genetic diversity and connectivity of populations has important conservation implications that can highlight management of priority populations to reverse the effects of human- caused extinctions.},

abstract = {Conifers are among the most genetically diverse plants but show the lowest levels of genetic differentiation, even among geographically distant populations. High gene flow among populations may be one of the most important factors in maintaining these genetic patterns. Here, we provide empirical evidence for extensive pollen-mediated gene dispersal between natural stands of a widespread northern temperate/boreal conifer, Picea glauca. We used 6 polymorphic allozyme loci to quantify the proportion of seeds sired by pollen originating from different sources in a landscape fragmented by agriculture in North Central Ontario, Canada. In 7 stands, a small proportion of seeds were sired by self-pollen or neighboring trees but 87.1{\%} (±1.7{\%} standard error [SE]) of seeds were sired by pollen from at least 250 to 3000 m away. In 4 single isolated trees, self-fertilization rates were low and more than 96{\%} (±1.3{\%} SE) of seeds were sired by immigrant pollen. The average minimum pollen dispersal distance in outcrossed matings was 619 m. These results provide strong evidence that extensive long-distance pollen dispersal plays a primary role in maintaining low genetic differentiation among natural populations of P. glauca and helps maintain genetic diversity and minimize inbreeding in small stands in a fragmented landscape.

abstract = {Abstract. Strong global demand for tropical timber and agricultural products has driven large-scale logging and subsequent conversion of tropical forests. Given that the majority of tropical landscapes have been or will likely be logged, the protection ofbiodiversity within tropical forests thus depends on whether species can persist in these economically exploited lands, and if species cannot persist, whether we can protect enough primary forest from logging and conversion. However, our knowledge of the impact of logging and conversion on biodiversity is limited to a few taxa, often sampled in different locations with complex land-use histories, hampering attempts to plan cost-effective conservation strategies and to draw conclusions across taxa. Spanning a land-use gradient of primary forest, once- and twice-logged forests, and oil palm plantations, we used traditional sampling andDNAmetabarcoding to compile an extensive data set inSabah,MalaysianBorneofornine vertebrate andinvertebrate taxa toquantify thebiological impacts of logging and oil palm, develop cost-effective methods of protecting biodiversity, and examinewhether there is congruence inresponse among taxa.Logged forests retained high species richness, including, on average, 70{\%}of species found in primary forest. In contrast, conversion to oil palmdramatically reduces species richness, with significantly fewer primary-forest species than foundonloggedforest transects for seventaxa.Usinga systematic conservationplanning analysis, we show that efficient protection of primary-forest species is achieved with land portfolios that include a large proportion of logged-forest plots. Protecting logged forests is thus a cost-effective method of protecting an ecologically and taxonomically diverse range of species, particularly when conservation budgets are limited. Six indicator groups (birds, leaf-litter ants, beetles, aerial hymenopterans, flies, and true bugs) proved to be consistently good predictors of the response of the other taxa to logging and oil palm. Our results confidently establish the high conservation value of logged forests and the low value of oil palm. Cross-taxon congruence in responses to disturbance also suggests that the practice of focusing on key indicator taxa yields important information of general biodiversity in studies of logging and oil palm.},

abstract = {• Premise of the study: Pollination patterns determine the reproductive neighborhood size of plants, the connectivity of populations, and the impacts of habitat fragmentation. We characterized pollination in three populations of Quercus macrocarpa occurring in a highly altered landscape in northeastern Illinois to determine whether isolated remnant stands were reproductively isolated. • Methods: We used microsatellites to genotype all adults and 787 acorns from two isolated savanna remnants and a stand in an old-growth forest. One isolated remnant occurred in a highly urbanized/industrialized landscape, and one occurred in an agricultural landscape. Parentage assignment was used to assess pollen-mediated gene flow. • Key results: Pollen donors from outside the study sites accounted for between 46{\%} and 53{\%} of paternities and did not differ significantly among sites, indicating that similar high levels of gene flow occurred at all three sites. Within stands, the mean pollination distance ranged from 42 to 70 meters, and when accounting for outside pollinations, mean pollination distances were well over 100 meters. Genetic diversity of incoming pollen was extremely high in all three stands. The number of effective pollen donors, N(ep), calculated from paternity assignment was higher than that estimated by an indirect correlated paternity approach. • Conclusions: Our findings indicate that extremely isolated stands of oaks are unlikely to be genetically and reproductively isolated, and remnant stands may contribute to maintaining genetic connectivity in highly modified landscapes.},

abstract = {The rapid expansion of next-generation sequencing has yielded a powerful array of tools to address fundamental biological questions at a scale that was inconceivable just a few years ago. Various genome partitioning strategies to sequence select subsets of the genome have emerged as powerful alternatives to whole genome sequencing in ecological and evolutionary genomic studies. High throughput targeted capture is one such strategy that involves the parallel enrichment of pre-selected genomic regions of interest. The growing use of targeted capture demonstrates its potential power to address a range of research questions, yet these approaches have yet to expand broadly across labs focused on evolutionary and ecological genomics. In part, the use of targeted capture has been hindered by the logistics of capture design and implementation in species without established reference genomes. Here we aim to 1) increase the accessibility of targeted capture to researchers working in non-model taxa by discussing capture methods that circumvent the need of a reference genome, 2) highlight the evolutionary and ecological applications where this approach is emerging as a powerful sequencing strategy, and 3) discuss the future of targeted capture and other genome partitioning approaches in light of the increasing accessibility of whole genome sequencing. Given the practical advantages and increasing feasibility of high-throughput targeted capture, we anticipate an ongoing expansion of capture-based approaches in evolutionary and ecological research, synergistic with an expansion of whole genome sequencing.

abstract = {Questions: Do small rocky outcrops favor forest plant colonization and establishment in grasslands? If so, what are the potential mechanisms involved in this process? Location: Araucaria forest and Campos grassland mosaic in southern Brazilian highlands (29°29'S, 50°12'W). Methods: We collected data on the density of forest woody species in plots located on rocky outcrops and in open fields subject to different management regimes. We evaluated the influence of outcrops on the density of forest plants {\textless}60 cm tall, and the effects of other environmental variables and of site on plant density; we also used information on diaspore traits of the species to discuss the way in which plants disperse to the outcrops. Results: Rocky outcrops harbored a significantly higher density of forest plants than open fields, irrespective of site effect, and rock height was the best predictor for plant density on outcrops. Diaspores of all recorded species possess characteristics associated with dispersal by birds or mammals or by both. Conclusions: Small rocky outcrops markedly influence forest expansion by acting as perches for vertebrate dispersers and as nurse objects and safe sites for plants. Forest expansion starting in small outcrops possibly occurs as follows: perching of dispersers and increase of seed rain on rocks, promotion of better conditions of establishment for forest plants by nurse rocks, protection of plants sensitive to grazing and fire, and nucleation of forest vegetation. {\textcopyright} 2010 International Association for Vegetation Science.},

abstract = {The Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association (American Psychological Association, 2001,2010) calls for the reporting of effect sizes and their confidence intervals. Estimates of effect size are useful for determining the practical or theoretical importance of an effect, the relative contributions of factors, and the power of an analysis. We surveyed articles published in 2009 and 2010 in the Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, noting the statistical analyses reported and the associated reporting of effect size estimates. Effect sizes were reported for fewer than half of the analyses; no article reported a confidence interval for an effect size. The most often reported analysis was analysis of variance, and almost half of these reports were not accompanied by effect sizes. Partial $\eta$2 was the most commonly reported effect size estimate for analysis of variance. For t tests, 2/3 of the articles did not report an associated effect size estimate; Cohen's d was the most often reported. We provide a straightforward guide to understanding, selecting, calculating, and interpreting effect sizes for many types of data and to methods for calculating effect size confidence intervals and power analysis. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Psychological Association.},

abstract = {We review the evidence of how organisms and populations are currently responding to climate change through phenotypic plasticity, genotypic evolution, changes in distribution and, in some cases, local extinction. Organisms alter their gene expression and metabolism to increase the concentrations of several antistress compounds and to change their physiology, phenology, growth and reproduction in response to climate change. Rapid adaptation and microevolution occur at the population level. Together with these phenotypic and genotypic adaptations, the movement of organisms and the turnover of populations can lead to migration toward habitats with better conditions unless hindered by barriers. Both migration and local extinction of populations have occurred. However, many unknowns for all these processes remain. The roles of phenotypic plasticity and genotypic evolution and their possible trade-offs and links with population structure warrant further research. The application of omic techniques to ecological studies will greatly favor this research. It remains poorly understood how climate change will result in asymmetrical responses of species and how it will interact with other increasing global impacts, such as N eutrophication, changes in environmental N : P ratios and species invasion, among many others. The biogeochemical and biophysical feedbacks on climate of all these changes in vegetation are also poorly understood. We here review the evidence of responses to climate change and discuss the perspectives for increasing our knowledge of the interactions between climate change and life.},

To achieve these goals, it is essential to foster the development of what we call efficient theories, which have several key attributes. Efficient theories are grounded in first principles, are usually expressed in the language of mathematics, make few assumptions and generate a large number of predictions per free parameter, are approximate, and entail predictions that provide well-understood standards for comparison with empirical data. We contend that the development and successive refinement of efficient theories provide a solid foundation for advancing environmental science in the era of big data.},

@article{Pironon2017,
abstract = {The ‘centre–periphery hypothesis' (CPH) is a long-standing postulate in ecology that states that genetic variation and demographic performance of a species decrease from the centre to the edge of its geographic range. This hypothesis is based on an assumed concordance between geographical peripherality and ecological marginality such that environmental conditions become harsher towards the limits of a species range. In this way, the CPH sets the stage for understanding the causes of distribution limits. To date, no study has examined conjointly the consistency of these postulates. In an extensive literature review we discuss the birth and development of the CPH and provide an assessment of the CPH by reviewing 248 empirical studies in the context of three main themes. First, a decrease in species occurrence towards their range limits was observed in 81{\%} of studies, while only 51{\%} demonstrated reduced abundance of individuals. A decline in genetic variation, increased differentiation among populations and higher rates of inbreeding were demonstrated by roughly one in two studies (47, 45 and 48{\%}, respectively). However, demographic rates, size and population performance less often followed CPH expectations (20–30{\%} of studies). We highlight the impact of important methodological, taxonomic, and biogeographical biases on such validation rates. Second, we found that geographic and ecological marginality gradients are not systematically concordant, which casts doubt on the reliability of a main assumption of the CPH. Finally, we attempt to disentangle the relative contribution of geographical, ecological and historical processes on the spatial distribution of genetic and demographic parameters. While ecological marginality gradients explain variation in species' demographic performance better than geographic gradients, contemporary and historical factors may contribute interactively to spatial patterns of genetic variation. We thereby propose a framework that integrates species' ecological niche characteristics together with current and past range structure to investigate spatial patterns of genetic and demographic variation across species ranges.},

abstract = {Demographic compensation—the opposing responses of vital rates along environmental gradients—potentially delays anticipated species' range contraction under climate change, but no consensus exists on its actual contribution. We calculated population growth rate ($\lambda$) and demographic compensation across the distributional ranges of 81 North American tree species and examined their responses to simulated warming and tree competition. We found that 43{\%} of species showed stable population size at both northern and southern edges. Demographic compensation was detected in 25 species, yet 15 of them still showed a potential retraction from southern edges, indicating that compensation alone cannot maintain range stability. Simulated climatic warming caused larger decreases in $\lambda$ for most species and weakened the effectiveness of demographic compensation in stabilising ranges. These findings suggest that climate stress may surpass the limited capacity of demographic compensation and pose a threat to the viability of North American tree populations.},

abstract = {The fragmentation of forests into small, isolated remnants may reduce pollen quantity and quality in natural plant populations. The reproductive success of white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss) was assessed in a landscape fragmented by agriculture in northern Ontario, Canada. We sampled a total of 23 stands and 104 white spruce trees from three different stand size classes. Each sampled stand was separated by 250-3000am from the nearest neighbouring stand. Reproductive success, measured as the number of filled seeds per cone, increased with stand size. The total number of seeds per cone, a measure that includes both filled and aborted seeds, also increased with stand size, suggesting that pollen receipt limits the number of seeds in a cone. The proportion of empty seeds (postzygotic abortions) was highest in the two smallest stand size classes, suggesting that inbreeding levels were also highest in these stands. We detected no difference in germination success, seedling growth, and growth of trees up to 10 years from seeds produced by trees from different stand size classes. These results suggest that inbred individuals are largely eliminated during the seed development stage. We estimated that a threshold population size of 180 trees is needed to reduce the negative effects of pollen limitation and inbreeding and maintain seed yields observed in large contiguous stands.},

abstract = {Biodiversity in wetlands is threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation, of which agricultural activities often are a cause. Dispersal of plant seeds via wind and ditches (water) may contribute to connecting remnant wetland plant populations in modern agricultural landscapes, and help to maintain and restore biodiversity. We developed a spatially explicit model to assess the relative importance of dispersal by wind and dispersal by water through drainage ditches for two wetland plant species in agricultural landscapes: a typical wind disperser and a typical water-disperser. Simulation results show that the typical wind disperser had a much higher capability to disperse by wind (90th percentile {\textless}30 m) than the typical water-disperser (90th percentile {\textless}2 m). Surprisingly, the capability to disperse via water was similar for the two species: 90th percentile dispersal distances following a combination of wind and water dispersal were between approximately 100 and 1000 m. Dispersal by water transported more seeds over long distances for both species. The main determinants for dispersal distance by water were roughness of the ditch (determined by, for example, bank vegetation) and the presence of obstructions (for example, culverts). Density or direction of the ditch network did not seem to affect water dispersal distances substantially. From a biodiversity conservation perspective, it would be most useful if areas with suitable riparian wetland habitat were intersected with a network of shallow ditches with a high roughness promoting seed deposition. These areas should then be connected to other suitable areas by a few regularly cleaned ditches with no obstructions and low seed trapping probability.},

abstract = {While African leopard populations are considered to be continuous as demon- strated by their high genetic variation, the southernmost leopard population exists in the Eastern and Western Cape, South Africa, where anthropogenic activities may be affecting this population's structure. Little is known about the elusive, last free-roaming top predator in the region and this study is the first to report on leopard population structuring using nuclear DNA. By analyzing 14 microsatellite markers from 40 leopard tissue samples, we aimed to under- stand the populations' structure, genetic distance, and gene flow (Nm). Our results, based on spatially explicit analysis with Bayesian methods, indicate that leopards in the region exist in a fragmented population structure with lower than expected genetic diversity. Three population groups were identified, between which low to moderate levels of gene flow were observed (Nm 0.5 to 3.6). One subpopulation exhibited low genetic differentiation, suggesting a con- tinuous population structure, while the remaining two appear to be less con- nected, with low emigration and immigration between these populations. Therefore, genetic barriers are present between the subpopulations, and while leopards in the study region may function as a metapopulation, anthropogenic activities threaten to decrease habitat and movement further. Our results indi- cate that the leopard population may become isolated within a few generations and suggest that management actions should aim to increase habitat connectiv- ity and reduce human–carnivore conflict. Understanding genetic diversity and connectivity of populations has important conservation implications that can highlight management of priority populations to reverse the effects of human- caused extinctions.},

abstract = {Forty-one endemic conifer species occur on New Caledonia's ultramafic substrates (known locally as "terrains miniers"), the source of nickel ore deposits being exploited at a rapidly increasing rate. Impacts of the removal of native vegetation and its destruction by the deposition of mine wastes are compounded by fire, which has dramatically reduced and fragmented the original cover. A new threat evaluation of these conifers, now being incorporated into the IUCN Red List, is presented. A conservation action plan is proposed to ensure their long term survival. Four species are classified as Critically Endangered (CR), 13 Endangered (EN), 6 Vulnerable (VU), 7 Nearly Threatened (NT) and 11 Least Concern. Wetland habitats contain two threatened species (i.e., CR, EN or VU), all inadequately protected in a single reserve. High altitude forest and maquis (a characteristic scrub-like vegetation) have four threatened and three NT conifers only partially encompassed in protected areas, some open to mining. Thirteen threatened species are restricted to low- and mid-elevation forests, and another three that can also occur on non-ultramafic substrates have isolated, unprotected populations in small forest remnants. Fire and land clearing for mining threaten two conifer species in low- to mid-elevation maquis along with subpopulations of five primarily forest species. Conserving the threatened conifers on terrains miniers will require coordinated measures including: comprehensive protection of forest remnants by forbidding mine waste stockpiling; establishment of new reserves, especially in key unprotected massifs; effective fire prevention; restoration of forest corridors between forest remnants; and multiplication/transplanting of selected species.},

Here, we illustrate the principles that underlie HMC and then compare the efficiency between Stan and a BUGS variant, JAGS (Plummer 2003), across a range of models in population ecology. Specifically, we test how HMC performance scales with model size and complexity, and its suitability for hierarchical models. Our goal is to explore the relative benefits of Stan and JAGS and to provide guidance for ecologists looking to use the power of HMC for faster and more robust Bayesian inference.

abstract = {The Neotropics have many plant species that seem to be adapted for seed dispersal by megafauna that went extinct in the late Pleistocene. Given the crucial importance of seed dispersal for plant persistence, it remains a mystery how these plants have survived more than 10,000 y without their mutualist dispersers. Here we present support for the hypothesis that secondary seed dispersal by scatter-hoarding rodents has facilitated the persistence of these large-seeded species. We used miniature radio transmitters to track the dispersal of reputedly megafaunal seeds by Central American agoutis, which scatter-hoard seeds in shallow caches in the soil throughout the forest. We found that seeds were initially cached at mostly short distances and then quickly dug up again. However, rather than eating the recovered seeds, agoutis continued to move and recache the seeds, up to 36 times. Agoutis dispersed an estimated 35{\%} of seeds for {\textgreater}100 m. An estimated 14{\%} of the cached seeds survived to the next year, when a new fruit crop became available to the rodents. Serial video-monitoring of cached seeds revealed that the stepwise dispersal was caused by agoutis repeatedly stealing and recaching each other's buried seeds. Although previous studies suggest that rodents are poor dispersers, we demonstrate that communities of rodents can in fact provide highly effective long-distance seed dispersal. Our findings suggest that thieving scatter-hoarding rodents could substitute for extinct megafaunal seed dispersers of tropical large-seeded trees.},

abstract = {Premise of the study: Pollination patterns determine the reproductive neighborhood size of plants, the connectivity of populations, and the impacts of habitat fragmentation. We characterized pollination in three populations of Quercus macrocarpa occurring in a highly altered landscape in northeastern Illinois to determine whether isolated remnant stands were reproductively isolated. Methods: We used microsatellites to genotype all adults and 787 acorns from two isolated savanna remnants and a stand in an old-growth forest. One isolated remnant occurred in a highly urbanized/industrialized landscape, and one occurred in an agricultural landscape. Parentage assignment was used to assess pollen-mediated gene flow. Key results: Pollen donors from outside the study sites accounted for between 46{\%} and 53{\%} of paternities and did not differ significantly among sites, indicating that similar high levels of gene flow occurred at all three sites. Within stands, the mean pollination distance ranged from 42 to 70 meters, and when accounting for outside pollinations, mean pollination distances were well over 100 meters. Genetic diversity of incoming pollen was extremely high in all three stands. The number of effective pollen donors, Nep, calculated from paternity assignment was higher than that estimated by an indirect correlated paternity approach. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that extremely isolated stands of oaks are unlikely to be genetically and reproductively isolated, and remnant stands may contribute to maintaining genetic connectivity in highly modified landscapes. {\textcopyright} 2010 Botanical Society of America.},

abstract = {What drives biodiversity and where are the most biodiverse places on Earth? The answer critically depends on spatial scale (grain), and is obscured by lack of data and mismatches in their grain. We resolve this with cross-scale models integrating global data on tree species richness (S) from 1338 local forest surveys and 287 regional checklists, enabling estimation of drivers and patterns of biodiversity at any desired grain. We uncover grain-dependent effects of both environment and biogeographic regions on S, with a positive regional effect of Southeast Asia at coarse grain that disappears at fine grains. We show that, globally, biodiversity cannot be attributed to purely environmental or regional drivers, since regions are environmentally distinct. Finally, we predict global maps of biodiversity at two grains, identifying areas of exceptional species turnover in China, East Africa, and North America. Our cross-scale approach unifies disparate results from previous studies regarding environmental versus biogeographic predictors of biodiversity, and enables efficient integration of heterogeneous data.},

abstract = {The effect of life-history traits on resource competition outcomes is well understood in the context of a constant resource supply. However, almost all natural systems are subject to fluctuations of resources driven by cyclical processes such as seasonality and tidal hydrology. To understand community composition, it is therefore imperative to study the impact of resource fluctuations on interspecies competition. We adapted a well-established resource-competition model to show that fluctuations in inflow concentrations of two limiting resources lead to the survival of species in clumps along the trait axis, consistent with observations of "lumpy coexistence" [Scheffer M, van Nes EH (2006) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 103:6230-6235]. A complex dynamic pattern in the available ambient resources arose very early in the self-organization process and dictated the locations of clumps along the trait axis by creating niches that promoted the growth of species with specific traits. This dynamic pattern emerged as the combined result of fluctuations in the inflow of resources and their consumption by the most competitive species that accumulated the bulk of biomass early in assemblage organization. Clumps emerged robustly across a range of periodicities, phase differences, and amplitudes. Given the ubiquity in the real world of asynchronous fluctuations of limiting resources, our findings imply that assemblage organization in clumps should be a common feature in nature.},

abstract = {Overhunting in tropical forests reduces populations of vertebrate seed dispersers. If reduced seed dispersal has a negative impact on tree population viability, overhunting could lead to altered forest structure and dynamics, including decreased biodiversity. However, empirical data showing decreased animal-dispersed tree abundance in overhunted forests contradict demographic models which predict minimal sensitivity of tree population growth rate to early life stages. One resolution to this discrepancy is that seed dispersal determines spatial aggregation, which could have demographic consequences for all life stages. We tested the impact of dispersal loss on population viability of a tropical tree species, Miliusa horsfieldii, currently dispersed by an intact community of large mammals in a Thai forest. We evaluated the effect of spatial aggregation for all tree life stages, from seeds to adult trees, and constructed simulation models to compare population viability with and without animal-mediated seed dispersal. In simulated populations, disperser loss increased spatial aggregation by fourfold, leading to increased negative density dependence across the life cycle and a 10-fold increase in the probability of extinction. Given that the majority of tree species in tropical forests are animal-dispersed, overhunting will potentially result in forests that are fundamentally different from those existing now.},

First we will give an introduction and overview on the most important processes and their impact on the genetic diversity of tropical trees, and then we will go in more details for some of the processes. The genetic diversity is of fundamental function for the stability of forest ecosystems. Thus adequate measures on gene conservation are very important. We will cover this topic with a specific chapter. More recently with the advance of genomics and molecular genetics, we have a broad set of molecular markers in hand for diagnostic purposes. We highlight as one important application the use of gene markers and DNA bar coding for tree species identification and as a tool to fight against illegal logging.

abstract = {Conifers are among the most genetically diverse plants but show the lowest levels of genetic differentiation, even among geographically distant populations. High gene flow among populations may be one of the most important factors in maintaining these genetic patterns. Here, we provide empirical evidence for extensive pollen-mediated gene dispersal between natural stands of a widespread northern temperate/boreal conifer, Picea glauca. We used 6 polymorphic allozyme loci to quantify the proportion of seeds sired by pollen originating from different sources in a landscape fragmented by agriculture in North Central Ontario, Canada. In 7 stands, a small proportion of seeds were sired by self-pollen or neighboring trees but 87.1{\%} (±1.7{\%} standard error [SE]) of seeds were sired by pollen from at least 250 to 3000 m away. In 4 single isolated trees, self-fertilization rates were low and more than 96{\%} (±1.3{\%} SE) of seeds were sired by immigrant pollen. The average minimum pollen dispersal distance in outcrossed matings was 619 m. These results provide strong evidence that extensive long-distance pollen dispersal plays a primary role in maintaining low genetic differentiation among natural populations of P. glauca and helps maintain genetic diversity and minimize inbreeding in small stands in a fragmented landscape. {\textcopyright} The American Genetic Association. 2007.

abstract = {Applying the recent developments of scale transition theory, we demonstrate a systematic approach to the problem of scaling up local scale interactions to regional scale dynamics with field data. Dynamics on larger spatial scales differ from the predictions of local dynamics alone because of an interaction between nonlinearity in population dynamics at the local scale and spatial variation in density and environmental factors over the regional population. Our systematic approach to scaling up involves the following five steps. First, define a model for dynamics on the local spatial scale. Second, apply scale transition theory to identify key interactions between nonlinearity and spatial variation that translate local dynamics to the regional scale. Third, measure local-scale model parameters to determine nonlinearities at local scales. Fourth, measure spatial variation. Finally, combine nonlinearity and variation measures to obtain the scale transition. Using field data for the dynamics of grazers and periphyton in a freshwater stream, we show that scale transition terms greatly reduce the growth and equilibrium density of the periphyton population at the stream scale compared to rock scale populations, confirming the importance of spatial mechanisms to stream-scale dynamics.},

abstract = {Global environmental change is expected to induce widespread changes in the geographic distribution and biomass of forest communities. Impacts have been projected from both empirical (statistical) and mechanistic (physiology-based) modelling approaches, but there remains an important gap in accurately predicting abundance across species' ranges from spatial variation in individual-level demographic processes. We address this issue by using a cohort-based forest dynamics model (CAIN) to predict spatial variation in the abundance of six plant functional types (PFTs) across the eastern U.S. The model simulates tree-level growth, mortality, and recruitment, which we parameterized from data on both individual-level demographic rates and population-level abundance using Bayesian inverse modelling. Across a set of 1° grid cells, we calibrated local growth, mortality, and recruitment rates for each PFT to obtain a close match between predicted age-specific PFT basal area in forest stands and that observed in 46 603 Forest Inventory and Analysis plots. The resulting models produced a strong fit to PFT basal area across the region (R2= 0.66-0.87), captured successional changes in PFT composition with stand age, and predicted the overall stem diameter distribution well. The mortality rates needed to accurately predict basal area were consistently higher than observed mortality, possibly because sampling effects led to biased individual-level mortality estimates across spatially heterogeneous plots. Growth and recruitment rates did not show consistent directional changes from observed values. Relative basal area was most strongly influenced by recruitment processes, but the effects of growth and mortality tended to increase as stands matured. Our study illustrates how both top-down (population-level) and bottom-up (individual-level) data can be combined to predict variation in abundance from size, environmental, and competitive effects on tree demography. Evidence for how demographic processes influence variation in abundance, as provided by our model, can help in understanding how these forests may respond to future environmental change.

abstract = {Forest gap models, initially conceived in 1969 as a special case of individual-tree based models, have become widely popular among forest ecologists for addressing a large number of applied research questions, including the impacts of global change on long-term dynamics of forest structure, biomass, and composition. However, they have been strongly criticized for a number of weaknesses inherent in the original model structure. In this paper, I review the fundamental assumptions underlying forest gap models, the structure of the parent model JABOWA, and examine these criticisms in the context of the many alternative formulations that have been developed over the past 30 years. Four assumptions originally underlie gap models: (1) The forest is abstracted as a composite of many small patches of land, where each can have a different age and successional stage; (2) patches are horizontally homogeneous, i.e., tree position within a patch is not considered; (3) the leaves of each tree are located in an indefinitely thin layer (disk) at the top of the stem; and (4) successional processes are described on each patch separately, i.e., there are no interactions between patches. These simplifications made it possible to consider mixed-species, mixed-age forests, which had been difficult previously mainly because of computing limitations. The structure of JABOWA is analysed in terms of the functional relationships used for formulating the processes of tree establishment, growth, and mortality. It is concluded that JABOWA contains a number of unrealistic assumptions that have not been questioned strongly to date. At the same time, some aspects of JABOWA that were criticized strongly in the past years are internally consistent given the objectives of this specific model. A wide variety of formulations for growth processes, establishment, and mortality factors have been developed in gap models over the past 30 years, and modern gap models include more robust parameterizations of environmental influences on tree growth and population dynamics as compared to JABOWA. Approaches taken in more recent models that led to the relaxation of one or several of the four basic assumptions are discussed. It is found that the original assumptions often have been replaced by alternatives; however, no systematic analysis of the behavioral effects of these conceptual changes has been attempted to date. The feasibility of including more physiological detail (instead of using relatively simple parameterizations) in forest gap models is discussed, and it is concluded that we often lack the data base to implement such approaches for more than a few commercially important tree species. Hence, it is important to find a compromise between using simplistic parameterizations and expanding gap models with physiology-based functions and parameters that are difficult to estimate. While the modeling of tree growth has received a lot of attention over the past years, much less effort has been spent on improving the formulations of tree establishment and mortality, although these processes are likely to be just as sensitive to global change as tree growth itself. Finally, model validation issues are discussed, and it is found that there is no single data source that can reliably be used for evaluating the behavior of forest gap models; instead, I propose a combination of sensitivity analyses, qualitative examinations of process formulations, and quantitative tests of gap models or selected submodels against various kinds of empirical data to evaluate the usefulness of these models for assessing their utility for predicting the impacts of global change on long-term forest dynamics.},

abstract = {Assisted migration has been proposed as a strategy for adaptive management of forest species in response to expected effects of climate change, but it is controversial for several reasons. Tropical dry forests are among the most threatened ecosystems in the world. In Mexico, historically, land-use change and deforestation have been decreasing forest cover, and climate change is shifting the potential distribution of different forest types, exacerbating the risk of local extinctions. Assisted altitudinal migration could be a feasible strategy for reducing local extinctions in response to climate change and lack of landscape connectivity. Our objective was to evaluate survival and growth of Albizia plurijuga and Ceiba aesculifolia, two tropical deciduous forests species in Mexico. We transplanted 4-month-old seedlings to experimental raised beds at three altitudes (2100, 2400 and 2700 m a.s.l.), exceeding their upper regional limit of distribution (2000 m a.s.l.). We also tested seed germination at each altitude. We monitored the experiment for 10 months. For both species, as altitude increased and cold weather was more prevalent, plant performance declined. Within species, differences in individual growth were significant among altitudes. Overall survival was 18.5{\%} for A. plurijuga and 24.5{\%} for C. aesculifolia. Both species had higher survival and better growth at lower altitude, and no seedling emergence at any altitude. We conclude that assisted migration can be implemented for each species by an upward attitudinal shift within, and not exceeding, 400 m beyond their present upper altitudinal limit of distribution. Our results indicate that for many species that show altitudinal gradients at regional scales, unless current climate conditions change, the potential to establish outside their range is minimal.},

abstract = {Climate is an important driver of forest health, productivity, and carbon cycle, but our understanding of these effects is limited for many regions and ecosystems. We present here a large-scale evaluation of climate effects on the productivity of three temperate tree species. We determine whether the National Forest Inventory data (NFI) collected in the Czech Republic (14,000 plots) and Slovakia (1,180 plots) contains sufficient information to be used for designing the regional climate-productivity models. Neural network-based models were used to determine which among 13 tested climate variables best predict the tree species-specific site index (SI). We also explored the differences in climate-productivity interactions between the drier and the moister part of the distribution of the investigated species. We found a strong climatic signal in spruce SI (R 0.45–0.62) but weaker signals in fir and beech (R 0.22–0.46 and 0.00–0.49, respectively). We identified the most influential climate predictors for spruce and fir, and found a distinct unimodal response of SI to some of these predictors. The dominance of water availability-related drivers in the dry-warm part of a species' range, and vice versa, was not confirmed. Based on our findings, we suggest that (i) the NFI-based SI is responsive to climate, particularly for conifers; (ii) climate-productivity models should consider the differences in productivity drivers along ecological gradients, and models should not be based on a mixture of dry and moist sites; and (iii) future studies might consider the subset of influential climate variables identified here as productivity predictors in climate-productivity models.},

abstract = {Genetic effects of habitat fragmentation may be undetectable because they are generally a recent event in evolutionary time or because of confounding effects such as historical bottlenecks and historical changes in species' distribution. To assess the effects of demographic history on the genetic diversity and population structure in the Neotropical tree Dipteryx alata (Fabaceae), we used coalescence analyses coupled with ecological niche modeling to hindcast its distribution over the last 21 000 years. Twenty-five populations (644 individuals) were sampled and all individuals were genotyped using eight microsatellite loci. All populations presented low allelic richness and genetic diversity. The estimated effective population size was small in all populations and gene flow was negligible among most. We also found a significant signal of demographic reduction in most cases. Genetic differentiation among populations was significantly correlated with geographical distance. Allelic richness showed a spatial cline pattern in relation to the species' paleodistribution 21 kyr BP (thousand years before present), as expected under a range expansion model. Our results show strong evidences that genetic diversity in D. alata is the outcome of the historical changes in species distribution during the late Pleistocene. Because of this historically low effective population size and the low genetic diversity, recent fragmentation of the Cerrado biome may increase population differentiation, causing population decline and compromising long-term persistence.},

abstract = {The lemurs of Madagascar represent a prodigious adaptive radiation. At least 17 species ranging from 11 to 160 kg have become extinct during the past 2000 years. The effect of this loss on contemporary lemurs is unknown. The concept of competitive release favours the expansion of living species into vacant niches. Alternatively, factors that triggered the extinction of some species could have also reduced community-wide niche breadth. Here, we use radiocarbon and stable isotope data to examine temporal shifts in the niches of extant lemur species following the extinction of eight large-bodied species. We focus on southwestern Madagascar and report profound isotopic shifts, both from the time when now-extinct lemurs abounded and from the time immediately following their decline to the present. Unexpectedly, the past environments exploited by lemurs were drier than the protected (albeit often degraded) riparian habitats assumed to be ideal for lemurs today. Neither competitive release nor niche contraction can explain these observed trends. We develop an alternative hypothesis: ecological retreat, which suggests that factors surrounding extinction may force surviving species into marginal or previously unfilled niches.},

abstract = {Increasing concern about loss of biodiversity and its effects on ecosystem functioning has triggered a series of manipulative experiments worldwide, which have demonstrated a general trend for ecosystem functioning to increase with diversity. General mechanisms proposed to explain diversity effects include complementary resource use and invoke a key role for species' functional traits. The actual mechanisms by which complementary resource use occurs remain, however, poorly understood, as well as whether they apply to tree-dominated ecosystems. Here we present an experimental approach offering multiple innovative aspects to the field of biodiversity-ecosystem functioning (BEF) research. The International Diversity Experiment Network with Trees (IDENT) allows research to be conducted at several hierarchical levels within individuals, neighborhoods, and communities. The network investigates questions related to intraspecific trait variation, complementarity, and environmental stress. The goal of IDENT is to identify some of the mechanisms through which individuals and species interact to promote coexistence and the complementary use of resources. IDENT includes several implemented and planned sites in North America and Europe, and uses a replicated design of high-density tree plots of fixed species-richness levels varying in functional diversity (FD). The design reduces the space and time needed for trees to interact allowing a thorough set of mixtures varying over different diversity gradients (specific, functional, phylogenetic) and environmental conditions (e.g., water stress) to be tested in the field. The intention of this paper is to share the experience in designing FD-focused BEF experiments with trees, to favor collaborations and expand the network to different conditions.},

abstract = {Plants are shifting their ranges towards higher elevations in response to global warming, yet such shifts are occurring at a rate slower than is needed to keep pace with a rapidly changing climate. There is, however, an almost complete lack of knowledge on seed dispersal across altitude, a key process to understand what constrains climate-driven range shifts. Here, we report the first direct empirical evidence on altitudinal seed dispersal mediated by two common frugivorous mammals: the red fox Vulpes vulpes and the pine marten Martes martes. We conducted a three-year (bait-marking) experiment in a mountainous region of Spain. We offered experimental fruits containing colour-coded seed mimics at feeding stations that simulated source trees. The colour codes allowed us to identify the exact origin of seed mimics found later in mammal scats. Nearly half (47{\%}) of the dispersal events occurred towards higher elevations, despite only ca 25{\%} of the study area being above the average altitude of the feeding stations (1344 m). Seeds dispersed uphill gained an average of 106 m (median = 111 m) and a maximum of 288 m, greatly exceeding the estimated requirements to escape warming (35.4 m per decade). Yet, foxes mediated much more uphill seed dispersal than martens (57{\%} and 26{\%} of dispersal events, respectively), which can be explained by between-disperser differences in home range size and habitat specificity. Dispersers with larger home ranges move farther and potentially disperse more seeds to higher altitudes, while habitat generalism is necessary to transport seeds above vegetation belts delimiting contrasting habitat types. We discuss how both traits (home range size and habitat specificity) can be used to infer altitudinal seed dispersal across disperser species and mountainous landscapes. ‘This},

Here, we used forest inventory data to characterize variation in adult tree abundance along climate gradients for the 24 most common tree species in the northeastern United States. The two components of our measure of species abundance—local frequency vs. relative abundance—showed dramatically different patterns of variation along gradients of mean annual temperature and precipitation. Local frequency (i.e., the percentage of plots in a given climate in which a species occurred) varied strongly for all 24 species, particularly as a function of temperature. Relative abundance when present in a plot, on the other hand, was effectively constant for most species right up to their estimated climatic range limits. Although the range limits for both temperature and precipitation were quite broad for all of the species, the range of climates within which a species was common (i.e., high frequency) was much narrower. Because frequency in sites within a given climate shows a strong sensitivity to temperature, at least, this suggests that the processes determining canopy tree recruitment on new sites also vary strongly with climate.},

abstract = {1. Tree mortality has important influences on forest structure and composition, but the mechanisms that cause tree mortality are not well understood. Asymmetric competition is known to be a dominant cause of plant mortality, but this idea has not received much attention in studies of long-lived trees. 2. We hypothesised that while tree mortality is dependent on size relative to neighbours as a result of asymmetric competition, tree mortality of shade-tolerant species varies little with size because of their physiological and morphological adaptations to shaded environments. Furthermore, we hypothesised that tree mortality is higher in more crowded stands because of higher average resource competition, in conspecific stands because of potential negative intra-specific interactions, and in older stands because of the physiological limitations and susceptibility to minor disturbances of large trees. 3. Using data from repeatedly measured permanent sampling plots that covered a wide range of tree sizes, stand developmental stages and stand compositions in boreal forests, we simultaneously tested, by boosted regression tree models, the effects of an individual's relative size, stand crowding, species interaction and ageing on mortality of Pinus banksiana, Populus tremuloides, Betula papyrifera and Picea mariana. 4. Mortality increased strongly with decreasing relative size for all study species, and the size-dependent mortality was stronger for shade-intolerant than for shade-tolerant species. With increasing stand basal area, mortality increased for Pinus banksiana, Populus tremuloides and Picea mariana but decreased for Betula papyrifera. Mortality was higher in stands with more conspecific neighbours for Populus tremuloides, Betula papyrifera and Picea mariana, but was slightly lower for Pinus banksiana. Mortality also increased with stand age for all species. Furthermore, the size-dependent mortality was generally stronger in more crowded stands. 5. Synthesis. Our findings show that tree mortality over a wide range of tree sizes, stand developmental stages and stand compositions in non-equilibrium boreal forests was strongly controlled by competition, but species interactions and ageing were also important mechanisms. Furthermore, the relative importance of these mechanisms to tree mortality differed with the shade tolerance of species.},

A total-exclusion battery comprising four chloroplast and two nuclear microsatellites (theoretical paternity exclusion probability EP = 0.996) was used to assign paternity to 813 seeds, collected from 34 trees in the stand. Long-distance pollen immigration accounted for 4.3{\%} of observed matings. Self-fertilization rate was very high (0.25), compared with typical values in more widespread populations of the species. The average effective pollen dispersal distance within the stand was 48 m (or 83 m excluding selfs). Half of effective pollen was dispersed within 11 m, and 7{\%} beyond 200 m. A strong correlation was found between the distance to the closest tree and the mean mating-distance calculated for single-tree progenies. The effective pollen dispersal distribution showed a leptokurtic shape, with a large and significant departure from that expected under uniform dispersal. A maximum-likelihood procedure was used to fit an individual pollen dispersal distance probability density function (dispersal kernel). The estimated kernel indicated fairly leptokurtic dispersal (shape parameter b = 0.67), with an average pollen dispersal distance of 135 m, and 50{\%} of pollen dispersed beyond 30 m. A marked directionality pattern of pollen dispersal was found, mainly caused by the uneven distribution of trees, coupled with restricted dispersal and unequal male success. Overall, results show that the number and distribution of potential pollen donors in small populations may strongly influence the patterns of effective pollen dispersal.},

abstract = {The dictionary definition of a law is: "Generalized formulation based on a series of events or processes observed to recur regularly under certain conditions; a widely observable tendency". I argue that ecology has numerous laws in this sense of the word, in the form of widespread, repeatable patterns in nature, but hardly any laws that are universally true. Typically, in other words, ecological patterns and the laws, rules and mechanisms that underpin them are contingent on the organisms involved, and their environment. This contingency is manageable at a relatively simple level of ecological organisation (for example the population dynamics of single and small numbers of species), and re-emerges also in a manageable form in large sets of species, over large spatial scales, or over long time periods, in the form of detail-free statistical patterns - recently called 'macroecology'. The contingency becomes overwhelmingly complicated at intermediate scales, characteristic of community ecology; where there are a large number of case histories, and very little other than weak, fuzzy generalisations. These arguments are illustrated by focusing on examples of typical studies in community ecology, and by way of contrast, on the macroecological relationship that emerges between local species richness and the size of the regional pool of species. The emergent pattern illustrated by local vs regional richness plots is extremely simple, despite the vast number of contingent processes and interactions involved in its generation. To discover general patterns, laws and rules in nature, ecology may need to pay less attention to the 'middle ground' of community ecology, relying less on reductionism and experimental manipulation. but increasing research efforts into macroecology.},

Multiple studies have linked plant species' demographic rates to commonly measured traits. However, predictive power is usually low – raising questions about the practical usefulness of traits – and analyses have been limited to size-independent univariate approaches restricted to a particular life stage.$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$n* Here we directly evaluated the predictive power of multiple traits simultaneously across the entire life cycle of 136 tropical tree species from central Panama. Using a model-averaging approach, we related wood density, seed mass, leaf mass per area and adult stature (maximum diameter) to onset of reproduction, seed production, seedling establishment, and growth and survival at seedling, sapling and adult stages.$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$n* Three of the four traits analysed here (wood density, seed mass and adult stature) typically explained 20–60{\%} of interspecific variation at a given vital rate and life stage. There were strong shifts in the importance of different traits throughout the life cycle of trees, with seed mass and adult stature being most important early in life, and wood density becoming most important after establishment. Every trait had opposing effects on different vital rates or at different life stages; for example, seed mass was associated with higher seedling establishment and lower initial survival, wood density with higher survival and lower growth, and adult stature with decreased juvenile but increased adult growth and survival.$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$n* Forest dynamics are driven by the combined effects of all demographic processes across the full life cycle. Application of a multitrait and full-life cycle approach revealed the full role of key traits, and illuminated how trait effects on demography change through the life cycle. The effects of traits on one life stage or vital rate were sometimes offset by opposing effects at another stage, revealing the danger of drawing broad conclusions about functional trait–demography relationships from analysis of a single life stage or vital rate. Robust ecological and evolutionary conclusions about the roles of functional traits rely on an understanding of the relationships of traits to vital rates across all life stages.$\backslash$n$\backslash$n},

abstract = {Climate warming is expected to cause the poleward and upward elevational expansion of temperate plant species, but non-climatic factors such as soils could constrain this range expansion. However, the extent to which edaphic constraints on range expansion have an abiotic (e.g. soil chemistry) or biotic (e.g. micro-organisms) origin remains undetermined. We conducted greenhouse experiments to test if the survival and growth of a major North American temperate tree species, Acer saccharum (sugar maple), is independently or jointly constrained by abiotic and biotic properties of field-collected soils from within and beyond the species' elevational range. Abiotic factors, particularly low base cation concentrations, were major constraints to seedling establishment in boreal forest soils (beyond the range edge), but insufficient arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal inoculum (biotic factor) also strongly reduced seedling performance in these soils. Synthesis. Our results suggest that forecasting future changes in forest composition under climate warming requires consideration of soil properties as well as the mycorrhizal status of tree species.},

abstract = {Robustness of coexistence against changes of parameters is investigated in a model-independent manner by analyzing the feedback loop of population regulation. We define coexistence as a fixed point of the community dynamics with no population having zero size. It is demonstrated that the parameter range allowing coexistence shrinks and disappears when the Jacobian of the dynamics decreases to zero. A general notion of regulating factors/variables is introduced. For each population, its impact and sensitivity niches are defined as the differential impact on, and the differential sensitivity towards, the regulating variables, respectively. Either the similarity of the impact niches or the similarity of the sensitivity niches results in a small Jacobian and in a reduced likelihood of coexistence. For the case of a resource continuum, this result reduces to the usual "limited niche overlap" picture for both kinds of niche. As an extension of these ideas to the coexistence of infinitely many species, we demonstrate that Roughgarden's example for coexistence of a continuum of populations is structurally unstable. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Variation in life-history strategies can affect metapopulation dynamics and consequently the composition and diversity of communities. However, data sets that allow for the full range of species turnover from colonization to extinction over relevant time periods are limited. The late Quaternary record provides unique opportunities to explore the traits that may have influenced interspecific variation in responses to past climate warming, in particular the rate at which species colonized newly suitable habitat or went locally extinct from degrading habitat. We controlled for differences in species climate niches in order to predict expected colonization and extinction sequences recorded in packrat middens from 15 localities in the Mohave, Sonoran, and Chihuahuan deserts of North America. After accounting for temperature niche differences, we tested the hypotheses that dispersal syndrome (none, wind, vertebrate), growth form (herb, shrub, tree) and seed mass mediated variation in postglacial colonization lags among species, whereas clonality (clonal, non-clonal), growth form, and seed mass affected extinction lags. Growth form and dispersal syndrome interactively affected colonization lags, where herbaceous species lacking long-distance dispersal mechanisms exhibited lags that exceeded those of woody, wind or vertebrate-dispersed species by an average of 2,000–5,000 yr. Growth form and seed mass interactively affected extinction lags, with very small-seeded shrubs persisting for 4,000–8,000 yr longer than other functional groups. Taller, vertebrate-dispersed plants have been shown in other studies to disperse farther than shorter plants without specialized dispersal mechanisms. We found that variation along this axis of dispersal syndromes resulted in dramatic differences in colonization rates in response to past climate change. Very small seeded shrubs may have a unique combination of long vegetative and seed bank lifetimes that may allow them to persist for long periods despite declines in habitat condition. This study indicates that readily measurable traits may help predict which species will be more or less sensitive to future climate change, and inform interventions that can stabilize and promote at-risk populations.},

abstract = {While niche-based processes have been invoked extensively to explain the structure of interaction networks, recent studies propose that neutrality could also be of great importance. Under the neutral hypothesis, network structure would simply emerge from random encounters between individuals and thus would be directly linked to species abundance. We investigated the impact of species abundance distributions on qualitative and quantitative metrics of 113 host-parasite networks. We analyzed the concordance between neutral expectations and empirical observations at interaction, species, and network levels. We found that species abundance accurately predicts network metrics at all levels. Despite host-parasite systems being constrained by physiology and immunology, our results suggest that neutrality could also explain, at least partially, their structure. We hypothesize that trait matching would determine potential interactions between species, while abundance would determine their realization.},

abstract = {A mosaic of Campos grassland and Araucaria forest characterizes the vegetation of the Southern Brazilian highland plateau. Palaeoecological evidence indicates that forest expansion over grassland initiated after the mid Holocene, when climate changed towards present day cool and moist conditions. In this paper, we discuss landscape level changes that occurred on vegetation patterns after grazing and fire exclusion in a mosaic of Campos and Araucaria forest in Southern Brazil. The analysis of aerial photographs from 1974 and 1999 showed alterations on grassland communities under grazing and fire exclusion, especially pronounced shrub establishment near the edge of the forest. Considering the change in the cover of vegetation classes relative to the total altered cover in all classes from 1974 to 1999, the most prominent alterations were: 48{\%} from grassland with tussock grasses dominance (GRA) to grassland with shrubs (GSR), 24{\%} from GRA to grassland with tall shrubs (GTS), 16{\%} from GSR to GTS and 9{\%} from GTS to forest (FOR). Considering the alteration relatively to the vegetation cover in 1974, the most relevant changes were: 44{\%} from GSR to GTS and 94{\%} from GTS to FOR. These observations support a directional forest expansion over grassland under grazing and fire exclusion. {\textcopyright} Akad{\'{e}}miai Kiad{\'{o}}, Budapest.},

In particular, weed infes- tation may cause severe losses of crop yield. Weeds have been traditionally managed solely at the field level. How- ever, larger scales must be considered because invasive and herbicide-tolerant weeds are spreading over larger scales. This review discusses three spatial scales at which agricultural management might affect the dispers- al of weeds and, in turn, their distribution and abun- dance in agricultural fields. The main points are: (1) at the field level, crop and margin management impact mass effect, i.e., local exchanges between the field margin and the cultivated field; (2) at the farm level crop allocation, the management of field boundaries and agricultural circu- lation in the farm strongly impact the intensity and direc- tion of weed dispersal; and (3) at the landscape level, the spatial farms distribution controls the distribution of weed habitat and, in turn, landscape species pool and long-distance weed dispersal. We conclude that weed dispersal is driven by agricultural management at multiple scales. Weed scientists should thus extend their view on weed dispersal from within-field scales to among-field and land- scape scales.},

To implement reasonable conservation, breeding and restorations program it is necessary to have the knowledge of pollen dispersal distance and fine-scale genetic structure. In this paper, levels and dispersion distance of pollen and spatial genetic structure of A.¬†angustifolia were investigated in a 14¬†ha transect in a continuous forest in Paran√° State, Brazil. Analyses have been performed by the use of eight microsatellite loci, paternity and TwoGener approaches, and spatial autocorrelation analysis. In transect, 52 male and 56 female adult trees were mapped and genotyped, together with 190 seeds. In the present transect, A.¬†angustifolia show spatial genetic structure at distances up to 75¬†m. Paternity analysis indicated that 54{\%} of seeds were fertilized by pollen from trees outside the transect. The calculated average pollination distance within transect was 102 and 98¬†m based on the paternity analysis and TwoGener analysis, respectively. We found a significant pollen gene pool structure across seed-trees ( Formula Not Shown , P¬†{\textless}¬†0.01) that corresponds to an effective number of pollen donors of 6.4 male trees or an effective pollination neighbourhood area (A ep ) of 2.1¬†ha. The findings suggest long-distance pollen dispersion ({\textgreater}100¬†m) inside the continuous forest. However, the high proportion occurs in short-distance producing biparental and correlated mating as well as reducing the variance effective size.},

abstract = {Premise of the study: The extent to which climate controls species' range limits is a classic biological question that is particularly relevant given anthropogenic climate change. While climate is known to play a role in species distributions, biotic interactions such as competition also affect range limits. Furthermore, climatic and biotic controls of ranges may vary in strength across life stages, implying complex range shift dynamics with climate change. Methods: We quantified climatic and competitive influences on growth of juvenile and adult trees of three conifer species on Mt. Rainier, Washington, United States. We collected annual growth data of these trees, which we compared to the competitive environment and annual climate (100 years of data) experienced by each individual. Key results: We found that the relationships between growth and climate and between growth and competition differed by life stage and location. Growth was sensitive to heavy snowpack and cold temperatures at high elevation upper limits (treeline), but growth was poorly explained by climate in low elevation closed-canopy forests. Competitive effects on growth were more important for saplings than adults, but did not become more important at either upper or lower range limits. Conclusions: In all, our results suggest that range shifts under climate change will differ at leading vs. trailing edges. At treeline, warmer temperatures will lead to increased growth and likely to range expansion. However, climate change will have less dramatic effects in low elevation closed-canopy forest communities, where growth is less strongly limited by climate, especially at young life stages. {\textcopyright} 2013 Botanical Society of America.},

The main goal of the present work was to describe the demographic structure of a natural A. angustifolia population. Therefore, the population studied was divided into four classes based on stage and gender: regeneration, juveniles, males and females. The diametric and height structures, sexual ratio, spatial and dependence patterns were evaluated. The results demonstrated that there was a small regeneration ratio and the sexual ratio was around 1:1, as previously expected for the species. In the spatial pattern analysis, aggregation groups appear in all classes studied. The regeneration showed clusters that do not seem to be associated to adult specimens. The natural regeneration occurs, but in low density under forest conditions.},

We test two broad classes of hypotheses to explain this pattern. Bottom-up hypotheses propose that the environment determines individual species' ranges. Ranges then sum up to yield species richness patterns. Top-down hypotheses propose that the environment limits the number of species that occur in a region, but not which ones. We test these two classes of hypotheses using a natural experiment: seasonal changes in environmental variables and seasonal range shifts of 625 migratory birds in the Americas. We show that richness seasonally tracks the environment. By contrast, individual species' geographical distributions do not. Rather, species occupy different sets of environmental conditions in two seasons. Our results are inconsistent with extant bottom-up hypotheses. Instead, a top-down mechanism appears to constrain the number of species that can occur in a given region.},

Such predictions have been tested with short-term plant removal experiments using two distinct indices evaluating the role of plant interactions: the intensity (absolute impact) and the importance (impact relative to that of other abiotic constraints) of plant interactions. 2. Using data on individual tree radial growth from more than 17 000 forest plots covering the habitat conditions of 16 species in the Alps and the Jura mountains of France, we show that non-manipulative estimates of plant interactions provide an alternative to this experimental approach. We developed a Bayesian neighbourhood growth competition model to test theoretical predictions about plant–plant interactions with a much larger spatio-temporal scope and set of study species than classically used in experimental studies of plant–plant interactions. 3. Our analyses revealed that competition – measured as neighbours effects on adult tree growth – varies in importance but not in intensity along two major bioclimatic gradients (degree-day sum and water availability). Observed patterns of competition importance differed between shade-tolerant and shade-intolerant tree species. First, the mean importance of competition was found to be much higher for shade-intolerant species. Second, for shade-intolerant species the importance of competition remained high even at low crowding indices (i.e. at a low competitor density), whereas for shade-tolerant species competition only became important at high crowding indices. {\{}4.Synthesis.{\}} Our non-manipulative approach to the study of plant–plant interactions allows analysing interactions among many species over large climatic gradients. Our results clearly demonstrate that a quantitative estimation of density dependence effects is key to understanding how plant–plant interactions vary along abiotic gradients. Growth predictions derived from our model can easily be integrated with other results on tree regeneration and mortality in individual-based models to investigate how plant–plant interactions drive tree population and community dynamics under varying climatic conditions.},

abstract = {Most species are exposed to significant environmental gradients across their ranges, but vital rates (survival, growth, reproduction and recruitment) need not respond in the same direction to those gradients. Opposing vital rate trends across environments, a phenomenon that has been loosely called 'demographic compensation', may allow species to occupy larger geographical ranges and alter their responses to climate change. Yet the term has never been precisely defined, nor has its existence or strength been assessed for multiple species. Here, we provide a rigorous definition, and use it to develop a strong test for demographic compensation. By applying the test to data from 26 published, multi-population demographic studies of plants, we show that demographic compensation commonly occurs. We also investigate the mechanisms by which this phenomenon arises by assessing which demographic processes and life stages are most often involved. In addition, we quantify the effect of demographic compensation on variation in population growth rates across environmental gradients, a potentially important determinant of the size of a species' geographical range. Finally, we discuss the implications of demographic compensation for the responses of single populations and species' ranges to temporal environmental variation and to ongoing environmental trends, e.g. due to climate change.},

Our definition of effect size is general and subsumes many existing definitions of effect size. We define effect size as a quantitative reflection of the magnitude of some phenomenon that is used for the purpose of addressing a question of interest. Our definition of effect size is purposely more inclusive than the way many have defined and conceptualized effect size, and it is unique with regard to linking effect size to a question of interest. Additionally, we review some important developments in the effect size literature and discuss the importance of accompanying an effect size with an interval estimate that acknowledges the uncertainty with which the population value of the effect size has been estimated.

abstract = {Climate-induced forest mortality is being increasingly observed throughout the globe. Alarmingly, it is expected to exacerbate under climate change due to shifting precipitation patterns and rising air temperature. However, the impact of concomitant changes in atmospheric humidity and CO2 concentration through their influence on stomatal kinetics remains a subject of debate and inquiry. By using a dynamic soil–plant–atmosphere model, mortality risks associated with hydraulic failure and stomatal clo- sure for 13 temperate and tropical forest biomes across the globe are analyzed. The mortality risk is evaluated in response to both individual and combined changes in precipitation amounts and their seasonal distribution, mean air temperature, specific humid- ity, and atmospheric CO2 concentration. Model results show that the risk is predicted to significantly increase due to changes in pre- cipitation and air temperature regime for the period 2050–2069. However, this increase may largely get alleviated by concurrent increases in atmospheric specific humidity and CO2 concentration. The increase in mortality risk is expected to be higher for needle- leaf forests than for broadleaf forests, as a result of disparity in hydraulic traits. These findings will facilitate decisions about intervention and management of different forest types under changing climate. forest},

abstract = {Aim: Range shifts associated with 20th-century warming have been documented for a wide range of taxa, but many species are not migrating fast enough to keep pace with the rapidly changing climate. Tree species can experience particularly long time lags in their migration response, resulting in altered forest composition and potentially delaying the migration of other obligate species. Here we review potential causes of these time lags and develop a conceptual framework for understanding how migration timing affects the observed rate of change. Location: Global forest ecosystems. Methods: We synthesize evidence from present-day tree species migrations to determine how different migration constraints can delay tree species range shifts. Results: The rate of present-day tree migrations is frequently slower than expected, and many factors may contribute to observed migration lags. Migration constraints can be overcome given the right combination of circumstances, resulting in episodic range shifts that create temporal variability in migration rates. Given projected increases in forest disturbances and extreme climatic events, episodic range shifts are likely. Main conclusions: Recent efforts to explain the slow rate of tree migration have primarily focused on dispersal limitation and niche-based constraints such as competition and other biotic interactions. We argue that these constraints cannot be fully understood without considering the temporal context of tree migration. Attempts to forecast and manage future distribution shifts must consequently consider how migration timing may affect observed patterns of change.},

Box 555, Nanyuki, Kenya Abstract.Many large mammal species are declining in African savannas, yet we understand relatively little about how these declines influence other species. Previous studies have shown that the removal of large herbivorous mammals from large-scale, replicated experimental plots results in a dramatic increase in the density of small mammals, an increase that has been attributed to the relaxation of competition between rodents and large herbivores for food resources. To assess whether the removal of large herbivores also influenced a predator of small mammals, we measured the abundance of the locally common olive hissing snake, , over a 19-mo period in plots with and without large herbivores. was significantly more abundant in plots where large herbivores were removed and rodent numbers were high. Based on results from raptor surveys and measurements of vegetative cover, differences in snake density do not appear to be driven by differences in rates of predation on snakes. Instead, snakes appear to be responding numerically to greater abundances of small-mammal prey in areas from which large herbivores have been excluded. This is the first empirical demonstration of the indirect effects of large herbivores on snake abundance and presents an interesting example of how the influence of dominant and keystone species can move through a food web.

abstract = {How to scale up from local-scale interactions to regional-scale dynamics is a critical issue in field ecology. We show how to implement a systematic approach to the problem of scaling up, using scale transition theory. Scale transition theory shows that dynamics on larger spatial scales differ from predictions based on the local dynamics alone because of an interaction between local-scale nonlinear dynamics and spatial variation in density or the environment. Based on this theory, a systematic approach to scaling up has four steps: (1) derive a model to translate the effects of local dynamics to the regional scale, and to identify key interactions between nonlinearity and spatial variation, (2) measure local-scale model parameters to determine nonlinearities at local scales, (3) measure spatial variation, and (4) combine nonlinearity and variation measures to obtain the scale transition. We illustrate the approach, with an example from benthic stream ecology of caddisflies living in riffles. By sampling from a simulated system, we show how collecting the appropriate data at local (riffle) scales to measure nonlinearities, combined with measures of spatial variation, leads to the correct inference for dynamics at the larger scale of the stream. The approach provides a way to investigate the mechanisms and consequences of changes in population dynamics with spatial scale using a relatively small amount of field data.},

abstract = {Premise of study: Have Gondwanan rainforest floral associations survived? Where do they occur today? Have they survived continuously in particular locations? How significant is their living floristic signal? We revisit these classic questions in light of significant recent increases in relevant paleobotanical data.
Methods: We traced the extinction and persistence of lineages and associations through the past across four now separated regions—Australia, New Zealand, Patagonia, and Antarctica—using fossil occurrence data from 63 well-dated Gondwanan rainforest sites and 396 constituent taxa. Fossil sites were allocated to four age groups: Cretaceous, Paleocene-Eocene, Neo-gene plus oligocene, and Pleistocene. We compared the modern and ancient distributions of lineages represented in the fossil record to see if dissimilarity increased with time. We quantified similarity-dissimilarity of composition and taxonomic structure among fossil assemblages, and between fossil and modern assemblages.
Key results: Strong similarities between ancient Patagonia and Australia confirmed shared Gondwanan rainforest history, but more of the lineages persisted in Australia. Samples of ancient Australia grouped with the extant floras of Australia, New Guinea, New Caledonia, Fiji, and Mt. Kinabalu. Decreasing similarity through time among the regional floras of Antarctica, Patagonia, New Zealand, and southern Australia reflects multiple extinction events.
Conclusions: Gondwanan rainforest lineages contribute significantly to modern rainforest community assembly and often co-occur in widely separated assemblages far from their early fossil records. Understanding how and where lineages from ancient Gondwanan assemblages co-occur today has implications for the conservation of global rainforest vegetation, including in the old World tropics.},

abstract = {1. Designing practical rules for controlling invasive species is a challenging task for managers, particularly when species are long-lived, have complex life cycles and high dispersal capacities. Previous findings derived from plant matrix population analyses suggest that effective control of long-lived invaders may be achieved by focusing on killing adult plants. However, the cost-effectiveness of managing different life stages has not been evaluated. 2. We illustrate the benefits of integrating matrix population models with decision theory to undertake this evaluation, using empirical data from the largest infestation of mesquite (Leguminosae: Prosopis spp) within Australia. We include in our model the mesquite life cycle, different dispersal rates and control actions that target individuals at different life stages with varying costs, depending on the intensity of control effort. We then use stochastic dynamic programming to derive cost-effective control strategies that minimize the cost of controlling the core infestation locally below a density threshold and the future cost of control arising from infestation of adjacent areas via seed dispersal. 3. Through sensitivity analysis, we show that four robust management rules guide the allocation of resources between mesquite life stages for this infestation: (i) When there is no seed dispersal, no action is required until density of adults exceeds the control threshold and then only control of adults is needed; (ii) when there is seed dispersal, control strategy is dependent on knowledge of the density of adults and large juveniles (LJ) and broad categories of dispersal rates only; (iii) if density of adults is higher than density of LJ, controlling adults is most cost-effective; (iv) alternatively, if density of LJ is equal or higher than density of adults, management efforts should be spread between adults, large and to a lesser extent small juveniles, but never saplings. 4. Synthesis and applications. In this study, we show that simple rules can be found for managing invasive plants with complex life cycles and high dispersal rates when population models are combined with decision theory. In the case of our mesquite population, focussing effort on controlling adults is not always the most cost-effective way to meet our management objective.},

abstract = {There is increasing interest in understanding the costs and benefits of increased size and prolonged lifespan for plants. Some species of trees can grow more than 100 m in height and can live for several millennia, however whether these achievements are obtained at the cost of some other physiological functions is currently unclear. As increases in size are usually associated with ageing, it is also unclear whether observed reductions in growth rates and increased mortality rates are a function of size or of age per se. One theory proposes that reduced growth after the start of the reproductive phase is caused by cellular senescence. A second set of theories has focussed instead on plant size and the increased respiratory burdens or excessive height. We report on experimental manipulations to separate the effects of extrinsic factors such as size from those of intrinsic factors such as age for four tree species of contrasting phylogeny and life history. For each species, we measured growth, gas exchange and leaf biochemical properties for trees of different ages and sizes in the field and on propagated material obtained from the same genetic individuals but now all of small similar size in our common gardens. For all species, evidence indicated that size, not cellular senescence, accounted for the observed age-related declines in relative growth rates and net assimilation rates. Two species exhibited evidence of genetic control on leaf characters such as specific leaf area, although size also exerted an independent, and stronger, effect. We found partial support for the theory of hydraulic limitations to tree growth. The lack of a marked separation of soma and germline, an unlimited proliferation potential of meristem cells and the exponential increase in reproductive effort with size all help explain the lack of a senescence-induced decline in trees. It is possible that trees much older than the ones we sampled exhibit senescence symptoms. {\textcopyright}2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

abstract = {The metacommunity perspective appears as an appropriate conceptual framework to make ecology more predictive. It is particularly relevant to limnology, where exchanges of organisms and nutrients affect community and ecosystem properties from the local to the regional scales. The recent development of neutral theory appears as a step back in that direction because of the assumption of ecological equivalence and the absence of any effect of the environment on community organization. A remarkable strength of neutral theory is nonetheless to provide a general theory of diversity that accounts for a wide range of empirical observations. In this paper, we argue that neutral theory can be useful to understand the impact of dispersal on community assembly in landscapes of various complexities. Our analysis focus on spatially explicit landscapes conceptualized as networks of local communities ( e.g ., lakes) connected to each other by dispersal channels ( e. g., rivers). The main objective of the paper is to use neutral theory to stress the importance of landscape structure on the distribution of diversity. We refer to the landscape organization as a spatial contingency that could potentially affect the coexistence mechanisms at play. We briefly review the main approaches to describe spatial networks and describe three simple toy models of metacommunity dynamics. We take this opportunity to review their assumptions and main predictions. We then conduct simulations of these models to reveal with simple examples the impact of spatial network structure on diversity distribution. The simulation results show that competitive interactions buffer the potential impact of landscape structure. The strongest relationship between node position in the landscape and species richness was observed for the patch dynamics model without any interactions. On the other hand, strong and unequal competitive interactions minimized the effect of node position. We conclude that the neutral model is a useful tool to understand the joint effects of dispersal and ecological interactions. Our analysis shows that limnologists must now integrate more realistic landscapes when analyzing community assembly from a metacommunity perspective.},

abstract = {The impact of climate change on forests is expected to vary globally and regionally. Canada's Acadian Forest Region lies in the transition between the North American boreal and temperate forest biomes and may be particularly sensitive to changes in climate because many of its component species are currently at their southern or northern climatic range limits. Although some species may be lost, others may exhibit major productivity boosts—affecting the goods and services we derive from them. In this study, we use a well-established forest ecosystem simulation model, PICUS, to provide the first exploration of the impact of climate change on the composition and growth of the Acadian Forest Region for the period 2011 to 2100 under two radiative forcing scenarios, RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5. In the short term (2011–2040), little to no changes in forest composition or growth were projected under either forcing scenario compared with current forest conditions (simulated for 1981–2010 baseline climate); however, by mid-century, PICUS projected increasing departures from the baseline simulations in both composition and growth, with the greatest changes occurring under RCP 8.5 during the late 21st century (2071–2100). Our study indicates that under rapid 21st century warming, Canada's Acadian Forest Region will begin to lose its boreal character (i.e., “deborealize”) as key tree species fail to regenerate and survive. Furthermore, increased growth and establishment by warm-adapted, temperate tree species may be unable to keep pace with the rapid loss of boreal species. This potential “lag effect” may lead to a temporary decrease in forest growth and wood supply during the late 21st century.},

Variation among individuals within populations allows species to differ in their distributions of responses to the environment, despite the fact that the populations to which they belong do not differ, on average.

abstract = {The conservation of genetic resources is a prerequisite for the maintenance of long-lived forest species. Araucaria araucana (Mol.) K. Koch is one of the oldest conifers in South America and a representative symbol of Chilean forest due to its endemicity and longevity. The aim of this study was to evaluate the genetic structure of the current A. araucana populations in Chile, to verify the possible genetic divergence between Coastal and Andean populations and to assess whether bottleneck events have influenced habitat fragmentation and threaten the genetic resources and evolutionary potential of the species. Twelve natural populations, nine from the Andes Cordillera and three from the Coast Cordillera were analysed by means of eight genomic microsatellite markers developed in A. araucana. Results of analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) highlighted significant differentiation between Coastal and Andean populations (16 {\%}; P = 0.004), detecting one significant barrier that separated populations from both Cordilleras as maximally differentiated areas. At local scale, both ranges revealed significant inter-population differentiation, with higher values for Coastal populations compared with Andean populations. These results suggested the presence of four gene pools (three in the Andes and one in the Coast Cordilleras) and one population (VIL) in the Coast Cordillera that differed to the rest. The differentiation between the Andean and Coastal populations may provide important baseline data that should allow further studies of landscape genetics in the species and that can contribute to develop conservation strategies for its genetic resources.},

However, as long as a species that is predicted to become extinct still persists, there is time for conservation measures such as habitat restoration and landscape management.

abstract = {Intensified exploitation of natural populations and habitats has led to increased mortality rates and decreased abundances of many species(1,2). There is a growing concern that this might cause critical abundance thresholds of species to be crossed(1,3-5), with extinction cascades and state shifts in ecosystems as a consequence(4,6,7). When increased mortality rate and decreased abundance of a given species lead to extinction of other species, this species can be characterized as functionally extinct even though it still exists. Although such functional extinctions have been observed in some ecosystems(3,4,8), their frequency is largely unknown. Here we use a new modelling approach to explore the frequency and pattern of functional extinctions in ecological networks. Specifically, we analytically derive critical abundance thresholds of species by increasing their mortality rates until an extinction occurs in the network. Applying this approach on natural and theoretical food webs, we show that the species most likely to go extinct first is not the one whose mortality rate is increased but instead another species. Indeed, up to 80{\%} of all first extinctions are of another species, suggesting that a species' ecological functionality is often lost before its own existence is threatened. Furthermore, we find that large-bodied species at the top of the food chains can only be exposed to small increases in mortality rate and small decreases in abundance before going functionally extinct compared to small-bodied species lower in the food chains. These results illustrate the potential importance of functional extinctions in ecological networks and lend strong support to arguments advocating a more community-oriented approach in conservation biology, with target levels for populations based on ecological functionality rather than on mere persistence(8-11).},

abstract = {The frequently observed positive correlation between species diversity and community biomass is thought to depend on both the degree of resource partitioning and on competitive dominance between consumers, two properties that are also central to theories of species coexistence. To make an explicit link between theory on the causes and consequences of biodiversity, we define in a precise way two kinds of differences among species: niche differences, which promote coexistence, and relative fitness differences, which promote competitive exclusion. In a classic model of exploitative competition, promoting coexistence by increasing niche differences typically, although not universally, increases the “relative yield total,” a measure of diversity's effect on the biomass of competitors. In addition, however, we show that promoting coexistence by decreasing relative fitness differences also increases the relative yield total. Thus, two fundamentally different mechanisms of species coexistence both strengthen the influence of diversity on biomass yield. The model and our analysis also yield insight on the interpretation of experimental diversity manipulations. Specifically, the frequently reported “complementarity effect” appears to give a largely skewed estimate of resource partitioning. Likewise, the “selection effect” does not seem to isolate biomass changes attributable to species composition rather than species richness, as is commonly presumed. We conclude that past inferences about the cause of observed diversity-function relationships may be unreliable, and that new empirical estimates of niche and relative fitness differences are necessary to uncover the ecological mechanisms responsible for diversity-function relationships.},

abstract = {Rates and spatial patterns of tree mortality are predicted to change during forest structural development. In young forests, mortality should be primarily density dependent due to competition for light, leading to an increasingly spatially uniform pattern of surviving trees. In contrast, mortality in old-growth forests should be primarily caused by contagious and spatially autocorrelated agents (e.g., insects, wind), causing spatial aggregation of surviving trees to increase through time. We tested these predictions by contrasting a three-decade record of tree mortality from replicated mapped permanent plots located in young ({\textless}60-year-old) and old-growth ({\textgreater}300-year-old) Abies amabilis forests. Trees in young forests died at a rate of 4.42{\%} per year, whereas trees in old-growth forests died at 0.60{\%} per year. Tree mortality in young forests was significantly aggregated, strongly density dependent, and caused live tree patterns to become more uniform through time. Mortality in old-growth forests was spatially aggregated, but was density independent and did not change the spatial pattern of surviving trees. These results extend current theory by demonstrating that density-dependent competitive mortality leading to increasingly uniform tree spacing in young forests ultimately transitions late in succession to a more diverse tree mortality regime that maintains spatial heterogeneity through time.

abstract = {In analogy to the species?area relationship (SAR), one of the few laws in ecology, the phylogenetic diversity?area relationship (PDAR) describes the tendency of phylogenetic diversity (PD) to increase with area. Although investigating PDAR has the potential to unravel the underlying processes shaping assemblages across spatial scales and to predict PD loss through habitat reduction, it has been little investigated so far. Focusing on PD has noticeable advantages compared to species richness (SR), since PD also gives insights on processes such as speciation/extinction, assembly rules and ecosystem functioning. Here we investigate the universality and pervasiveness of the PDAR at continental scale using terrestrial mammals as study case. We define the relative robustness of PD (compared to SR) to habitat loss as the area between the standardized PDAR and standardized SAR (i.e., standardized by the diversity of the largest spatial window) divided by the area under the standardized SAR only. This metric quantifies the relative increase of PD robustness compared to SR robustness. We show that PD robustness is higher than SR robustness but that it varies among continents. We further use a null model approach to disentangle the relative effect of phylogenetic tree shape and nonrandom spatial distribution of evolutionary history on the PDAR. We find that, for most spatial scales and for all continents except Eurasia, PDARs are not different from expected by a model using only the observed SAR and the shape of the phylogenetic tree at continental scale. Interestingly, we detect a strong phylogenetic structure of the Eurasian PDAR that can be predicted by a model that specifically account for a finer biogeographical delineation of this continent. In conclusion, the relative robustness of PD to habitat loss compared to species richness is determined by the phylogenetic tree shape but also depends on the spatial structure of PD.},

However, these techniques are ostensibly inapplicable for experimental systems where data are scarce or expensive to obtain. Here, we introduce a strategy to resolve this impasse by augmenting the experimental dataset with synthetically generated data of a much simpler sister system. Specifically, we study spontaneously emerging local order in crease networks of crumpled thin sheets, a paradigmatic example of spatial complexity, and show that machine learning techniques can be effective even in a data-limited regime. This is achieved by augmenting the scarce experimental dataset with inexhaustible amounts of simulated data of rigid flat-folded sheets, which are simple to simulate and share common statistical properties. This considerably improves the predictive power in a test problem of pattern completion and demonstrates the usefulness of machine learning in bench-top experiments where data are good but scarce.},

Both markers revealed high gene diversity (H = 0.65; A(R)=9.1 for microsatellites and H=0.27; P=77.8{\%} for AFLPs), moderate overall differentiation (R-ST=0.13 for microsatellites and F-ST= 0-10 for AFLPs), but high divergence of the northernmost, geographically isolated population. In a Bayesian analysis, microsatellite data suggested population structure at two levels: at K= 2 and at K= 3 in agreement to the geographical distribution of populations. This result was confirmed by the UPGMA dendrogram based on microsatellite data (bootstrap support {\textgreater} 95{\%}). Non-hierarchical AMOVA revealed high variation among populations from different a posteriori defined geographical groups. The genetic distance between sample locations increased with geographical distance for microsatellites (r = 0.62; p = 0.003) and AFLPs (r= 0.32; p = 0.09). This pattern of population differentiation may be correlated with population history such as geographical isolation and postglacial colonization of highlands. implications of the population genetic structure for the conservation of genetic resources are discussed.},

abstract = {Speciation is the "elephant in the room" of community ecology. As the ultimate source of biodiversity, its integration in ecology's theoretical corpus is necessary to understand community assembly. Yet, speciation is often completely ignored or stripped of its spatial dimension. Recent approaches based on network theory have allowed ecologists to effectively model complex landscapes. In this study, we use this framework to model allopatric and parapatric speciation in networks of communities. We focus on the relationship between speciation, richness, and the spatial structure of communities. We find a strong opposition between speciation and local richness, with speciation being more common in isolated communities and local richness being higher in more connected communities. Unlike previous models, we also find a transition to a positive relationship between speciation and local richness when dispersal is low and the number of communities is small. We use several measures of centrality to characterize the effect of network structure on diversity. The degree, the simplest measure of centrality, is the best predictor of local richness and speciation, although it loses some of its predictive power as connectivity grows. Our framework shows how a simple neutral model can be combined with network theory to reveal complex relationships between speciation, richness, and the spatial organization of populations.},

There is a lack of information and data about the species ecology that could be used as the basis for preservation and management measures. Intending to alleviate the this lack of data, this study was carried out based on a natural population of A. angustifolia occurring in the Forest Genetic Reserve of Ca{\c{c}}ador, located in the Brazilian state of Santa Catarina. The main goal of the present work was to describe the demographic structure of a natural A. angustifolia population. Therefore, the population studied was divided into four classes based on stage and gender: regeneration, juveniles, males and females. The diametric and height structures, sexual ratio, spatial and dependence patterns were evaluated. The results demonstrated that there was a small regeneration ratio and the sexual ratio was around 1:1, as previously expected for the species.

abstract = {Demographic and ecophysiological data for the endangered New Caledonian conifer, Araucaria muelleri (Araucariaceae), were analysed to: (i) evaluate population viability in relation to site conditions and human impacts; and (ii) advance our understanding of how stress-tolerator plant functional traits affect the population dynamic behaviour and conservation requirements of long-lived tree species. Growth, survivorship and recruitment in four A. muelleri populations were monitored across 9 years. Demographic rates were analysed using stage-based transition matrices. Leaf $\delta$13C, {\%}N and photosystem II stress (Fv/Fm) were measured for seedlings, saplings and trees, and leaf mass per area (LMA) for trees, and correlations among ecophysiological and demographic variables explored. Seedling, sapling and tree stem growth were among the slowest, and annual survivorship among the highest, reported for any tree. Transition matrix analyses yielded stable estimated population growth rates, $\lambda$, not significantly different from 1.0 for all populations. Leaf $\delta$13C was positively correlated with seedling and sapling height growth, while daytime photosystem II stress (Fv/Fm) was high in seedlings, but low in saplings and trees. Ecophysiological measures suggest that individuals transition from moisture-limited growth at the seedling stage to nutrient-limited growth as adults. High levels of environmental stress result in slow stand dynamics, characterized by low recruitment and growth rates counterbalanced by equally low mortality rates. These dynamics result in populations with limited capacity to increase in size quickly, but potentially highly vulnerable to decline should the rate of adult mortality increase. This combination of traits is likely typical of extreme stress-tolerator woody species and suggests a conservation focus on the preservation of mature individuals.},

abstract = {1. Mortality is a key process in ecology and evolution, and much effort is spent on development Accepted Article and application of statistical and theoretical models involving mortality. Mortality takes place in continuous time, and a fundamental representation of mortality risks is the mortality hazard rate, which is the intensity of deadly events that an individual is exposed to at any point in time. In discrete-time population models, however, the mortality process is represented by survival or mortality probabilities, which are aggregate functions of the mortality hazard rates within given intervals. In this commentary, we argue that focussing on mortality hazard rates, also when using discrete-time models, aids the construction of biologically reasonable models and improves ecological inference. 2. We discuss three topics in population ecology where hazard rates can be particularly useful for biological inference, but are nevertheless often not used: (i) modelling of covariate effects, (ii) modelling of multiple sources of mortality and competing risks, and (iii) elasticity analyses of population growth rate with respect to demographic parameters. To facilitate estimation of cause-specific mortality hazard rates, we provide extensions to the R package ‘marked'. 3. Using mortality hazard rates sometimes makes it easier to formulate biologically reasonable models with more directly interpretable parameterizations and more explicit assumptions. In particular, interpretations about relative differences between mortality hazard rates, or effects of relative changes in mortality hazard rates on population growth (elasticities), are often more meaningful than interpretations involving relative differences in survival (or mortality) probabilities or odds. 4. The concept of hazard rates is essential for understanding ecological and evolutionary processes and we give an intuitive explanation for this, using several examples. We provide some practical guidelines and suggestions for further methods developments.},

abstract = {Although early theoretical work suggests that competition for light erodes successional diversity in forests, verbal models and recent numerical work with complex mechanistic forest simulators suggest that disturbance in such systems can maintain successional diversity. Nonetheless, if and how allocation trade-offs between competitors interact with disturbance to maintain high diversity in successional systems remains poorly understood. Here, using mechanistic and analytically tractable models, we show that a theoretically unlimited number of coexisting species can be maintained by allocational trade-offs such as investing in light-harvesting organs versus height growth, investing in reproduction versus growth or survival versus growth. The models describe the successional dynamics of a forest composed of many patches subjected to random or periodic disturbance, and are consistent with physiologically mechanistic terrestrial ecosystem models, including the terrestrial components of recent Earth System Models. We show that coexistence arises in our models because species specialize in the successional time they best exploit the light environment and convert resources into seeds or contribute to advance regeneration. We also show that our results are relevant to non-forested ecosystems by demonstrating the emergence of similar dynamics in a mechanistic model of competition for light among annual plant species. Finally, we show that coexistence in our models is relatively robust to the introduction of intraspecific variability that weakens the competitive hierarchy caused by asymmetric competition for light.},

abstract = {Hutchinson defined species' realized niche as the set of environmental conditions in which populations can persist in the presence of competitors. In terms of demography, the realized niche corresponds to the environments where the intrinsic growth rate (r) of populations is positive. Observed species occurrences should reflect the realized niche when additional processes like dispersal and local extinction lags do not have overwhelming effects. Despite the foundational nature of these ideas, quantitative assessments of the relationship between range-wide demographic performance and occurrence probability have not been made. This assessment is needed both to improve our conceptual understanding of species' niches and ranges and to develop reliable mechanistic models of species geographic distributions that incorporate demography and species interactions. The objective of this study is to analyse how demographic parameters (intrinsic growth rate r and carrying capacity K) and population density (N) relate to occurrence probability (Pocc ). We hypothesized that these relationships vary with species' competitive ability. Demographic parameters, density, and occurrence probability were estimated for 108 tree species from four temperate forest inventory surveys (Qu{\'{e}}bec, Western US, France and Switzerland). We used published information of shade tolerance as indicators of light competition strategy, assuming that high tolerance denotes high competitive capacity in stable forest environments. Interestingly, relationships between demographic parameters and occurrence probability did not vary substantially across degrees of shade tolerance and regions. Although they were influenced by the uncertainty in the estimation of the demographic parameters, we found that r was generally negatively correlated with Pocc , while N, and for most regions K, was generally positively correlated with Pocc . Thus, in temperate forest trees the regions of highest occurrence probability are those with high densities but slow intrinsic population growth rates. The uncertain relationships between demography and occurrence probability suggests caution when linking species distribution and demographic models.},

abstract = {Climate change and natural disturbances are catalyzing forest transitions to different vegetation types, but whether these new communities are resilient alternate states that will persist for decades to centuries is not known. Here, we test how changing climate, disturbance, and biotic interactions shape the long‐term fate of a deciduous broadleaf forest type that replaces black spruce after severe wildfires in interior Alaska, USA. We simulated postfire deciduous forest that replaced black spruce after severe fires in 2004 for tens to hundreds of years under different climate scenarios (contemporary, mid 21st century, late 21st century), fire return intervals (11‐250 years), distances to seed source (50‐1,000 m), and browsing intensities (background, moderate, chronic). We identified combinations of conditions where deciduous forest remained the dominant vegetation type and combinations where it returned to black spruce forest, transitioned to mixed forest (where deciduous species and black spruce co‐dominate), or converted to nonforest. Deciduous forest persisted in 86{\%} of simulations and was most resilient if fire return intervals were short (≤ 50 years). When transitions to another vegetation type occurred, mixed forest was most common, particularly when fire return intervals were long ({\textgreater}50 years) and the nearest seed source was 500 m or farther. Moderate and chronic browsing also reduced deciduous sapling growth and survival, helping black spruce compete if fire return intervals were long and seed source was distant. Dry soils occasionally caused conversion to nonforest following short‐interval fire when simulations were forced with a late 21st‐century climate scenario that projects warming and increased vapor pressure deficit. Return to black spruce forest almost never occurred. Synthesis. Conversion from black spruce to deciduous forest is already underway at regional scales in interior Alaska, and similar transitions have been widely observed throughout the North American boreal biome. We show this boreal deciduous forest type is likely a resilient alternate state that will persist through the 21st century, which is important, because future vegetation outcomes will shape biophysical feedbacks to regional climate and influence subsequent disturbance regimes.},

abstract = {It is argued that the problem of pattern and scale is the central problem in ecology, unifying population biology and ecosystems science, and marrying basic and applied ecology. Applied challenges, such as the prediction of the ecological causes and consequences of global climate change, require the interfacing of phenomena that occur on very different scales of space, time, and ecological organization. Furthermore, there is no single natural scale at which ecological phenomena should be studied; systems generally show characteristic variability on a range of spatial, temporal, and organizational scales. The observer imposes a perceptual bias, a filter through which the system is viewed. This has fundamental evolutionary significance, since every organism is an "observer" of the environment, and life history adaptations such as dispersal and dormancy alter the perceptual scales of the species, and the observed variability. It likewise has fundamental significance for our own study of ecological systems, since the patterns that are unique to any range of scales will have unique causes and biological consequences. The key to prediction and understanding lies in the elucidation of mechanisms underlying observed patterns. Typically, these mechanisms operate at different scales than those on which the patterns are observed; in some cases, the patterns must be understood as emerging from the collective behaviors of large ensembles of smaller scale units. In other cases, the pattern is imposed by larger scale constraints. Examination of such phenomena requires the study of how pattern and variability change with the scale of description, and the development of laws for simplification, aggregation, and scaling. Examples are given from the marine and terrestrial literatures.},

abstract = {The extension of growing season at high northern latitudes seems increasingly clear from satellite observations of vegetation extent and duration. This extension is also thought to explain the observed increase in amplitude of seasonal variations in atmospheric CO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} concentration. Increased plant respiration and photosynthesis both correlate well with increases in temperature this century and are therefore the most probable link between the vegetation and CO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} observations. From these observations, it has been suggested that increases in temperature have stimulated carbon uptake in high latitudes and for the boreal forest system as a whole. Here we present multi- proxy tree-ring data (ring width, maximum late-wood density and carbon- isotope composition) from 20 productive stands of white spruce in the interior of Alaska. The tree-ring records show a strong and consistent relationship over the past 90 years and indicate that, in contrast with earlier predictions, radial growth has decreased with increasing temperature. Our data show that temperature-induced drought stress has disproportionately affected the most rapidly growing white spruce, suggesting that, under recent climate warming, drought may have been an important factor limiting carbon uptake in a large portion of the North American boreal forest. If this limitation in growth due to drought stress is sustained, the future capacity of northern latitudes to sequester carbon may be less than currently expected.},

abstract = {Anaerobic digestion of residual materials from animals and crops offers an opportunity to simultaneously produce bioenergy and plant fertilizers at single farms and in farm communities where input substrate materials and resulting digested residues are shared among member farms. A surplus benefit from this practice may be the suppressing of propagules from harmful biological pests like weeds and animal pathogens (e.g. parasites). In the present work, batch experiments were performed, where survival of seeds of seven species of weeds and non-embryonated eggs of the large roundworm of pigs, Ascaris suum, was assessed under conditions similar to biogas plants managed at meso- (37. ??C) and thermophilic (55. ??C) conditions. Cattle manure was used as digestion substrate and experimental units were sampled destructively over time. Regarding weed seeds, the effect of thermophilic conditions (55. ??C) was very clear as complete mortality, irrespective of weed species, was reached after less than 2 days. At mesophilic conditions, seeds of Avena fatua, Sinapsis arvensis, Solidago canadensis had completely lost germination ability, while Brassica napus, Fallopia convolvulus and Amzinckia micrantha still maintained low levels (???1{\%}) of germination ability after 1 week. Chenopodium album was the only weed species which survived 1 week at substantial levels (7{\%}) although after 11. d germination ability was totally lost. Similarly, at 55. ??C, no Ascaris eggs survived more than 3. h of incubation. Incubation at 37. ??C did not affect egg survival during the first 48. h and it took up to 10. days before total elimination was reached. In general, anaerobic digestion in biogas plants seems an efficient way (thermophilic more efficient than mesophilic) to treat organic farm wastes in a way that suppresses animal parasites and weeds so that the digestates can be applied without risking spread of these pests. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

Describing size-specific mortality patterns can be especially difficult, due to few trees in larger size classes. We used permanent plot data from Nothofagus solandri var. cliffortioides (mountain beech) forest on the eastern slopes of the Southern Alps, New Zealand, where the fates of trees on 250 plots of 0.04 ha were followed, to examine: (1) patterns of size-specific mortality over three consecutive periods spanning 30 years, each characterised by different disturbance, and (2) the strength and direction of neighbourhood crowding effects on size-specific mortality rates. We found that the size-specific mortality function was U-shaped over the 30-year period as well as within two shorter periods characterised by small-scale pinhole beetle and windthrow disturbance. During a third period, characterised by earthquake disturbance, tree mortality was less size dependent. Small trees ({\textless}20 cm in diameter) were more likely to die, in all three periods, if surrounded by a high basal area of larger neighbours, suggesting that size-asymmetric competition for light was a major cause of mortality. In contrast, large trees (≥ 20 cm in diameter) were more likely to die in the first period if they had few neighbours, indicating that positive crowding effects were sometimes important for survival of large trees. Overall our results suggest that temporal variability in size-specific mortality patterns, and positive interactions between large trees, may sometimes need to be incorporated into models of forest dynamics.},

We argue that population genetics theory may be misapplied in light of ecological realities that, when recognized, require scrutiny of underlying evolutionary assumptions. One ecological reality is that fragment boundaries often do not represent boundaries for mating populations of trees that benefit from long-distance pollination, sometimes abetted by long-distance seed dispersal. Where fragments do not delineate populations, genetic theory of small populations does not apply. Even in spatially isolated populations, where genetic theory may eventually apply, evolutionary arguments assume that samples from fragmented populations represent trees that have had sufficient time to experience drift, inbreeding, and ultimately inbreeding depression, an unwarranted assumption where stands in fragments are living relicts of largely unrelated predisturbance populations. Genetic degradation may not be as important as ecological degradation for many decades following habitat fragmentation.},

abstract = {The forest growth model 4C was used to investigate how conversion management of a Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) stand towards a mixed oak-birch stand would affect stand structural development - and hence biodiversity and productivity - in the long term. For this purpose the 4C model was parameterised for natural regeneration of light demanding species and extended for management of multi-layered stands. A series of structural indicators was selected to describe key factors of forest biodiversity at the stand scale. Two consecutive aspects of Scots pine conversion were tested: (1) the choice of conversion strategy between thinning and gap creation and (2) the choice of conversion regime in terms of cutting cycle, thinning type and pine tree retention. Three simulated conversion strategies aim at the gradual removal of the pine canopy but differ in the spatial organisation of pine cuttings and hence result in different light conditions for regeneration. Only the directed gap creation strategy was able to maintain and increase birch admixture to the stand and to approach natural stand structural development. Simulation of 12 conversion regimes for the directed gap creation strategy indicated that thinning type (from above or from below), pine tree retention at final felling (50{\%} of the standing volume or none) and cutting cycle (6, 9 or 12 years) all significantly influence stand structural development. These effects were clearest for oak development. Birch occurred in a few mixed clusters, but tended to disappear when longer cutting cycles were used. Based on a multi-criteria analysis we conclude that the optimal conversion regime - in which both stand productivity and biodiversity objectives can be combined - implies thinning from above, pine tree retention, and cutting cycles of 6 years. The conceptual validity of the model as well as the applicability of the results are discussed. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Publisher Summary$\backslash$nThis chapter describes the various aspects of cereal-legume intercropping systems. Intercropping is the growing of two or more crop species simultaneously in the same field during a growing season. The intercropping of legumes with cereals offers scope for developing energy-efficient and sustainable agriculture. The main types of intercropping include mixed intercropping, row intercropping, and strip intercropping. Crop combinations differ with geographical location and there may be intercropping of tree crops, intercropping of tree and field crops, or intercropping of field crops. Combinations of crops are determined primarily by the length of the growing season and the adaptation of crops to particular environments. Different indices have been suggested for evaluating productivity and efficiency per unit area of land of cereal-legume intercrop systems. These include comparisons of absolute yields, protein yields, caloric equivalent, and in economic terms, gross returns from intercrops and sole crops. Differences in competitive ability affect the relative performance of component crops and thus the land equivalent ratio values of different cereal-legume intercrop systems. It is found that phosphorus is a major nutrient that determines the production potential of most grain legumes usually intercropped with cereals.},

Despite their potential, they have seldom been used for studying species range dynamics explicitly. In this perspective paper, we make the case that DVMs should be used to this end and can improve our understanding of the factors that influence species range expansions and contractions. We review the benefits of using process-based, dynamic models, emphasizing how DVMs can be applied specifically to questions about species range dynamics. Subsequently, we provide a critical evaluation of some of the limitations and trade-offs associated with DVMs, and we use those to guide our discussions about future model development. This includes a discussion on which processes are lacking, specifically a mechanistic representation of dispersal, inclusion of the seedling stage, trait variability, and a dynamic representation of reproduction. We also discuss upscaling techniques that offer promising solutions for being able to run these models efficiently over large spatial extents. Our aim is to provide directions for future research efforts and to illustrate the value of the DVM approach.},

abstract = {Despite their narrow distribution, Australian rainforests still contain considerable levels of diversity and include many ancient, but often rare, lineages. Very little is known about the general biology of rainforest species, yet their long-term management depends on a better understanding of the main factors leading to rarity. For instance, are they highly endemic taxa, at the early stages of expansion, nearing the end of a period of decline, or persisting at low numbers over the long term? In this study we combine molecular, environmental, and ecological data to identify the factors responsible for the narrow distribution of a paleoendemic rainforest tree: Elaeocarpus sedentarius (Elaeocarpaceae). Between-population and between-generation comparisons of genetic diversity across all known populations of E. sedentarius show evidence of mutation-drift equilibrium rather than evidence of a recent bottleneck. Similarly, floristic and environmental data negate the hypothesis of rarity as a consequence of highly specialized habitat requirements. Instead, genetic structure and the available ecological data support the hypothesis of dispersal limitation as the main cause of endemism and that the species may have attained genetic equilibrium without realizing its full niche potential. We suggest that these factors are likely to explain narrow endemism in a broader range of taxa.},

The annual cycle of the Azure Jay in araucaria forest may be divided into three periods: foraging for araucaria seeds (April to July), foraging for small animals, especially insects (August and September) and reproduction and care of the young (October to March). Communal breeding is probably the reproduction strategy of the Azure Jay, as in the majority of the New World jays: a group presumed helpers was often seen around the nest and was observed mobbing a Roadside Hawk (Buteo magnirostris). Two foraging strategies were utilized by the flock: division into subgroups to search for clustered food sources (araucaria seed) or moving together through the vegetation scanning for randomly dispersed food such as insects or small animals.},

abstract = {Plant-frugivore mutualistic assemblages frequently combine multiple, complementary or not (i.e. redundant), distinct effects of animal species. To a large extent, the outcomes of these interactions crucially depend on the delayed consequences of frugivore effectiveness on plant recruitment. We evaluated seed dispersal effectiveness for three plant species in a Brazilian Atlantic forest with a marked habitat heterogeneity defined by bamboo and non-bamboo patches. Twenty one, 23 and 14 bird species ate fruits of Euterpe edulis, Sloanea guianensis and Virola bicuhyba trees, respectively. For both Euterpe and Virola, visitation rate was the variable contributing for most variance across frugivore species in the quantitative component of effectiveness (QC, which depends on the combined effects of interaction frequency and per-interaction effect), while the number of fruits manipulated/visit had the greatest contribution in Sloanea. By combining observational data and experimental seed addition for Euterpe we tested for consistent functional patterns among species in the frugivore assemblage, extending beyond the fruit removal stage. Rankings of QC across Euterpe frugivores remained consistent with their relative contributions to fruit removal and, importantly, with their contributions to seedling establishment. Yet, QC of effectiveness across Euterpe frugivores were more homogeneous at the fruit removal and dispersal stages (contribution to seed dispersal) than for the delayed, dissemination and post-dispersal effects on recruitment. High complementarity of diversified frugivore assemblages may increase through added variance in their delayed effects related to qualitative components of effectiveness. Our results underscore the importance of assessing how dispersal services provided by mutualistic frugivores play complementary, rather than redundant, roles in seed dispersal within heterogeneous landscapes. Such ecological outcomes highlight the value of combining observational and experimental field designs to assess functional diversity patterns of tropical frugivore assemblages and delayed effects of their interactions with plants.},

This study examined the effect of ensiling, digestion by cattle and storage in slurry and farmyard manure on the germination and viability of the seeds of one susceptible and three resistant C. album populations. After 4 weeks in a maize silo, seed viability of C. album populations was reduced drastically to 0–5{\%}. Incubation for 24 h in the rumen followed by a post-ruminal digestion in vitro of intact seeds only resulted in a small reduction in viability in one C. album population. Storage in a slurry cellar for 16 weeks reduced the viability of intact seeds of the C. album populations to 25–60{\%}. Only 0–1{\%} of the seeds remained viable after storage in a farmyard manure heap for 4 weeks. An accelerated ageing experiment showed seed persistence to be population specific and less related to seed weight. Keeping a fresh maize silo closed for at least 4 weeks and heaping farmyard manure are excellent preventive measures to limit the spread of resistant C. album seeds between fields.},

abstract = {Long-distance seed dispersal is generally assumed to be important for the regional survival of plant species. In this study, we quantified the importance of long-distance seed dispersal for regional survival of plant species using wind dispersal as an example. We did this using a new approach, by first relating plant species' dispersal traits to seed dispersal kernels and then relating the kernels to regional survival of the species. We used a recently developed and tested mechanistic seed dispersal model to calculate dispersal kernels from dispersal traits. We used data on 190 plant species and calculated their regional survival in two ways, using species distribution data from 36,800 1 km(2)-grid cells and 10,754 small plots covering the Netherlands during the largest part of the 20th century. We carried out correlation and stepwise multiple regression analyses to quantify the importance of long-distance dispersal, expressed as the 99-percentile dispersal distance of the dispersal kernels, relative to the importance of median-distance dispersal and other plant traits that are likely to contribute to the explanation of regional survival: plant longevity (annual, biennial, perennial), seed longevity, and plant nutrient requirement. Results show that long-distance dispersal plays a role in determining regional survival, and is more important than median-distance dispersal and plant longevity. However, long-distance dispersal by wind explains only 1-3{\%} of the variation in regional survival between species and is equally important as seed longevity and much less important than nutrient requirement. In changing landscapes such as in the Netherlands, where large-scale eutrophication and habitat destruction took place in the 20th century, plant traits indicating ability to grow under the changed, increasingly nutrient-rich conditions turn out to be much more important for regional survival than seed dispersal.},

Species interact directly with each other and indirectly through environmental effects, however to our knowledge the role of these ecosystem engineers has not been considered in ecological network models. Here we explore the dynamics of ecosystem assembly, where species colonization and extinction depends on the constraints imposed by trophic, service, and engineering dependencies. We show that our assembly model reproduces many key features of ecological systems, such as the role of generalists during assembly, realistic maximum trophic levels, and increased nestedness with mutualistic interactions. We find that ecosystem engineering has large and nonlinear effects on extinction rates. While small numbers of engineers reduce stability by increasing primary extinctions, larger numbers of engineers increase stability by reducing primary extinctions and extinction cascade magnitude. Our results suggest that ecological engineers may enhance community diversity while increasing persistence by facilitating colonization and limiting competitive exclusion.},

The establishment, growth, survival and reproduction of ca 2500 individuals were followed in permanent plots over 10 yr. Growth and survival rates for A. laubenfelsii show that it is a long-lived, slow growing tree, with evidence of suppression in the sapling size classes in mature rain forest. Growth rates for all size classes are generally faster in maquis than rain forest. Transition matrix analyses estimated positive rates of population increase (l values41), with populations expanding in maquis, and stable in mature forest. Araucaria laubenfelsii is able to regenerate continuously in maquis and early successional rain forest, but recruitment is limited in older stands. Life table response experiment analyses showed that reproduction, and transitions from sapling to mature tree stage, contributed positively to l in maquis, but negatively in forest. Araucaria laubenfelsii on Mont Do can be considered a long-lived pioneer, with early maquis colonizers helping to drive succession from maquis to forest. While opportunities for recruitment decline with time as rain forest sites develop a closed canopy, occasional gap phase recruitment, combined with disturbance by cyclones, landslides and fire, provide opportunities to ensure species persistence. Understanding contrasting population dynamics of A. laubenfelsii in maquis and rain forest will better facilitate conservation management of this species, particularly given current high rates of land conversion and degradation in New Caledonia.},

abstract = {Although human-driven landscape modification is generally characterized by habitat destruction and fragmentation, it may also result in the creation of new habitat patches, providing conditions conducive to spontaneous colonization. In this article, we propose the concept of " colonization credit" (i.e., the number of species yet to colonize a patch, following landscape changes) as a framework to evaluate the success of colonization, in terms of species richness, in new/restored habitats, taking into account the spatial structure of landscapes. The method mirrors similar approaches used to estimate extinction debt in the context of habitat fragmentation, that is, comparisons, between old and new habitat patches, of the relationships among spatial patch metrics and patch species richness. We applied our method to the case of spontaneous colonization of newly created habitat patches suitable for wet heathland plant communities in South Belgium. Colonization credit was estimated for the total species richness, the specialist species richness, and the species richness of three emergent groups (EGs) of specialist species, delineated on the basis of dispersal traits. No significant colonization credit was identified either in patches created 25-55 years ago or in those created within the past 25 years, with the exception of species from our first EG (mostly anemochorous species with long-term persistent seed bank). However, the differential response of species in that first EG could not be explained through their characteristic life history traits. The results of this study are encouraging and suggest that deliberate, directed restoration activities could yield positive developments in a relatively short period of time. {\textcopyright} 2009 Society for Ecological Restoration International.},

abstract = {Abstract Selecting among competing statistical models is a core challenge in science. However, the many possible approaches and techniques for model selection, and the conflicting recommendations for their use, can be confusing. We contend that much confusion surrounding statistical model selection results from failing to first clearly specify the purpose of the analysis. We argue that there are three distinct goals for statistical modeling in ecology: data exploration, inference, and prediction. Once the modeling goal is clearly articulated, an appropriate model selection procedure is easier to identify. We review model selection approaches and highlight their strengths and weaknesses relative to each of the three modeling goals. We then present examples of modeling for exploration, inference, and prediction using a time series of butterfly population counts. These show how a model selection approach flows naturally from the modeling goal, leading to different models selected for different purposes, even with exactly the same data set. This review illustrates best practices for ecologists and should serve as a reminder that statistical recipes cannot substitute for critical thinking or for the use of independent data to test hypotheses and validate predictions.},

abstract = {Niche-driven effects on demographic processes generated in response to habitat heterogeneity partly shape local distributions of species. Thus, tree distributions are commonly studied in relation to habitat conditions to understand how niche differentiation contributes to species coexistence in forest communities. Many such studies implicitly assume that local abundance reflects habitat suitability, and that abundance is relatively stable over time. We compared models based on abundance with those based on demographic performance for making inferences about habitat association for 287 tree species from three large dynamic plots located in tropical, subtropical and temperate forests. The correlation between the predictions of the abundance-based models and the demography-based models varied widely, with correlation coefficients ranging nearly from -1 to 1. This suggests that the two types of models capture different information about species-habitat associations. Demography-based models evaluate habitat quality by focusing on population processes and thus should be preferred for understanding responses of tree species to habitat conditions, especially when habitat conditions are changing and species-habitat interactions cannot be considered to be at equilibrium.},

abstract = {Intensified exploitation of natural populations and habitats has led to increased mortality rates and decreased abundances of many species(1,2). There is a growing concern that this might cause critical abundance thresholds of species to be crossed(1,3-5), with extinction cascades and state shifts in ecosystems as a consequence(4,6,7). When increased mortality rate and decreased abundance of a given species lead to extinction of other species, this species can be characterized as functionally extinct even though it still exists. Although such functional extinctions have been observed in some ecosystems(3,4,8), their frequency is largely unknown. Here we use a new modelling approach to explore the frequency and pattern of functional extinctions in ecological networks. Specifically, we analytically derive critical abundance thresholds of species by increasing their mortality rates until an extinction occurs in the network. Applying this approach on natural and theoretical food webs, we show that the species most likely to go extinct first is not the one whose mortality rate is increased but instead another species. Indeed, up to 80{\%} of all first extinctions are of another species, suggesting that a species' ecological functionality is often lost before its own existence is threatened. Furthermore, we find that large-bodied species at the top of the food chains can only be exposed to small increases in mortality rate and small decreases in abundance before going functionally extinct compared to small-bodied species lower in the food chains. These results illustrate the potential importance of functional extinctions in ecological networks and lend strong support to arguments advocating a more community-oriented approach in conservation biology, with target levels for populations based on ecological functionality rather than on mere persistence(8-11).},

abstract = {Modelers have to make choices about which functional forms to use for representing model components, such as the relationship between the state of individuals and their vital rates. Even though these choices significantly influence model predictions, this type of structural uncertainty has been largely ignored in theoretical ecology. In this paper, we use integral projection models (IPMs) for Platte thistle as a case study to illustrate that the choice of functional form characterizing density dependence in seedling recruitment has important implications for predicting transient dynamics (short-term population dynamics following disturbances). In one case, the seedling recruitment function is modeled as a power function, and in the other case, we derive density dependence in seedling recruitment from biological first principles. We chose parameter values for the recruitment functions such that both IPMs predicted identical equilibrium population densities and both recruitment functions fit the empirical recruitment data sufficiently well. We find that the recovery from a transient attenuation, and the magnitude of transient amplification, can vary tremendously depending on which function is used to model density-dependent seedling recruitment. When we loosen the restriction of having identical equilibrium densities, model predictions not only differ in the short term but also in the long term. We derive some mathematical properties of the IPMs to explain why the short-term differences occur. ? 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

@article{May1972,
abstract = {The relationship between environmental variability and niche overlap is studied for a class of model biological communities in which several species compete on a one-dimensional continuum of resources, e.g., food size. In a strictly unvarying (deterministic) environment, there is in general no limit to the degree of overlap, short of complete congruence. However, in a fluctuating (stochastic) environment, the average food sizes for species adjacent on the resource spectrum must differ by an amount roughly equal to the standard deviation in the food size taken by either individual species. This mathematical result emerges in a nonobvious yet robust way for environmental fluctuations whose variance relative to their mean ranges from around 0.01{\%} to around 30{\%}. In short, there is an effective limit to niche overlap in the real world, and this limit is insensitive to the degree of environmental fluctuation, unless it be very severe. Recent field work, particularly on bird guilds, seems in harmony with the model's conclusion.},

Using remote camera traps we tested if defaunated forests have a lower seed predation rate of a keystone palm (Euterpe edulis) than pristine areas. Contrary to our expectation, we found that seed predation rates were 2.5 higher in defaunated forests and small rodents were responsible for most of the seeds eaten.

abstract = {Geographically isolated and small populations outside a species' central distribution range are likely to be of major importance to a species' ability to quickly adjust its distribution range to global change dynamics. Gene flow from the outside plays a pivotal role in the fate of these marginal populations. It has been proposed that spatial fragmentation and perceived geographic isolation do not necessarily reflect a loss of genetic connectivity in tree species. However, the spatial limits of long-distance gene flow, as well as its magnitude and impact, are still generally unknown. In the present study, we analyzed long-distance pollen-mediated gene flow into an isolated relict stand consisting of 7 individuals of Quercus robur L. based on a total sample of 177 trees and 9 microsatellite loci. We show that pollen-mediated gene flow across more than 80 km in this wind-pollinated tree species contributed at least 35{\%} of all successful pollinations in the investigated isolated and small oak stand at the eastern limit of the species' distribution. The observed pollen immigration shaped the genetic diversity of acorn progenies in the stand and might explain the comparably high genetic diversity in the persisting adult population. {\textcopyright} 2011 The American Genetic Association.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd/CNRS. Humans require multiple services from ecosystems, but it is largely unknown whether trade-offs between ecosystem functions prevent the realisation of high ecosystem multifunctionality across spatial scales. Here, we combined a comprehensive dataset (28 ecosystem functions measured on 209 forest plots) with a forest inventory dataset (105,316 plots) to extrapolate and map relationships between various ecosystem multifunctionality measures across Europe. These multifunctionality measures reflected different management objectives, related to timber production, climate regulation and biodiversity conservation/recreation. We found that trade-offs among them were rare across Europe, at both local and continental scales. This suggests a high potential for 'win-win' forest management strategies, where overall multifunctionality is maximised. However, across sites, multifunctionality was on average 45.8-49.8{\%} below maximum levels and not necessarily highest in protected areas. Therefore, using one of the most comprehensive assessments so far, our study suggests a high but largely unrealised potential for management to promote multifunctional forests.},

abstract = {Community assembly rules have been extensively studied, but its association with regional environmental variation, while land use history remains largely unexplored. Land use history might be especially important in Mediterranean forests, considering their historical deforestation and recent afforestation. Using forest inventories and historical (1956) and recent (2000) land cover maps, we explored the following hypotheses: 1) woody species assembly is driven by environmental factors, but also by historical landscape attributes; 2) recent forests exhibit lower woody species richness than pre-existing due to the existence of colonization credits; 3) these credits are modulated by species' life-forms and dispersal mechanisms. We examined the association of forest historical type (pre-existing versus recent) with total species richness and that of diverse life-forms and dispersal groups, also considering the effects of current environment and past landscape factors. When accounting for these effects, no significant differences in woody species richness were found between forest historical types except for vertebrate-dispersed species. Species richness of this group was affected by the interaction of forest historical type with distance to coast and rainfall: vertebrate-dispersed species richness increased with rainfall and distance to the coast in recent forests, while it was higher in dryer sites in pre-existing forests. In addition, forest historical types showed differences in woody species composition associated to diverse environmental and past landscape factors. In view of these results we can conclude that: 1) community assembly in terms of species richness is fast enough to exhaust most colonization credit in recent Mediterranean forests except for vertebrate-dispersed species; 2) for these species, colonization credit is affected by the interplay of forest history and a set of proxies of niche and landscape constraints of species dispersal and establishment; 3) woody species assemblage is mostly shaped by the species' ecological niches in these forests.},

However, more complex dynamics are possible and may lead to memory effects and alternate unstable states. We develop graphical and analytic methods for assessing these scenarios and show that these dynamics can appear in even simple models. The overall implications are that (1) complex community dynamics may be common and (2) detailed knowledge of past climate change and community states will often be necessary yet sometimes insufficient to make predictions of a community's future state.},

abstract = {Trawling has been reported worldwide to alter seabed structure, and thus benthic habitats and ecosystems. Usually, a decrease in species richness and biomass is observed, and community structure is modified towards more opportunistic species. The Gulf of St Lawrence (Canada) has been intensely exploited since the 17th century, including net, longline, dredge and trawl fishing activities. Recently, the collapse of groundfish stocks induced a shift in fishing practices toward shrimp trawling, which is currently considered a sustainable fishing activity in the region. However, no long-term study has evaluated the potential effects of trawling disturbances on benthic mega-invertebrates. We investigated whether shrimp trawling had long- (ca. 20 years), mid- (ca. 10 years), and short-term (ca. 4 years) impacts on benthic mega-invertebrate taxa richness, biomass, and community structure. Scientific and fishery trawling data analyses showed that no significant long-, mid-, or short-term effect was detected on taxa richness. Significant but weak effects on biomass and community structure were detected at the mesoscale, i.e. at the scale of fishing grounds. In this long-exploited ecosystem, we suggest that a critical level of disturbance was attained by the first gear passages, which occurred decades ago and had irreversible impacts on the seabed by removing vulnerable taxa and structures that provided three-dimensional habitats. It is likely that benthic communities have subsequently reached a disturbed state of equilibrium on which current trawling disturbance has limited or no further impacts.},

Combining demographic studies, analyses of demographic responses to environmental variation, and species distribution models, we investigated the causes of range limits in a model system, the eastern border of the California annual plant Clarkia xantiana ssp. xantiana. Vital rates of 20 populations varied with growing season temperature and precipitation: fruit number and overwinter survival of 1-year-old seeds declined steeply, while current-year seed germination increased modestly along west-to-east gradients in decreasing temperature, decreasing mean precipitation, and increasing variation in precipitation. Long-term stochastic finite rate of increase, $\lambda$(s), exhibited a fourfold range and varied among geologic surface materials as well as with temperature and precipitation. Growth rate declined significantly toward the eastern border, falling below 1 in three of the five easternmost populations. Distribution models employing demographically important environmental variables predicted low habitat favorability beyond the eastern border. Models that filtered or weighted population presences by $\lambda$(s) predicted steeper eastward declines in favorability and assigned greater roles in setting the distribution to among-year variation in precipitation and to geologic surface material. These analyses reveal a species border likely set by limited adaptation to declining environmental quality.},

A small population of W. nobilis was discovered in 1994 in a remote canyon system in the Wollemi National Park (near Sydney, Australia). This population contains fewer than 100 individuals and is critically endangered. Previous genetic studies of the Wollemi pine have investigated its evolutionary relationship with other pines in the family Araucariaceae, and have suggested that the Wollemi pine genome contains little or no variation. However, these studies were performed prior to the widespread use of genome sequencing, and their conclusions were based on a limited fraction of the Wollemi pine genome. In this study, we address this problem by determining the entire sequence of the W. nobilis chloroplast genome. A detailed analysis of the structure of the genome is presented, and the evolution of the genome is inferred by comparison with the chloroplast sequences of other members of the Araucariaceae and the related family Podocarpaceae. Pairwise alignments of whole genome sequences, and the presence of unique pseudogenes, gene duplications and insertions in W. nobilis and Araucariaceae, indicate that the W. nobilis chloroplast genome is most similar to that of its sister taxon Agathis. However, the W. nobilis genome contains an unusually high number of repetitive sequences, and these could be used in future studies to investigate and conserve any remnant genetic diversity in the Wollemi pine.},

abstract = {Investigations of the role of competition, predation and abiotic stress in shaping natural communities were a staple for previous generations of ecologists and are still popular themes. However, more recent experimental research has uncovered the largely unanticipated, yet striking influence of facilitation (i.e. positive species interactions) on the organization of terrestrial and aquatic communities. Modern ecological concepts and theories were well established a decade before the current renaissance of interest in facilitation began, and thus do not consider the importance of a wide variety of facilitative interactions. It is time to bring ecological theory up to date by including facilitation. This process will not be painless because it will fundamentally change many basic predictions and will challenge some of our most cherished paradigms. But, ultimately, revising ecological theory will lead to a more accurate and inclusive understanding of natural communities.},

abstract = {A simple mathematical model of competition is developed that includes two alternative mechanisms promoting successional diversity. The first underpins the competition-colonization hypothesis in which early successional species are able to persist because they colonize disturbed habitats before the arrival of late successional dominant competitors. The second underpins the niche hypothesis, in which early successional species are able to persist, even with unlimited colonization by late successional dominants, because they specialize on the resource-rich conditions typical of recently disturbed sites. We modify the widely studied competition-colonization model so that it also includes the mechanism behind the niche hypothesis. Analysis of this model suggests simple experiments that determine whether the successional diversity of a field system is maintained primarily by the competition-colonization mechanism, primarily by the niche mechanism, by neither, or by both. We develop quantitative metrics of the relative importance of the two mechanisms. We also discuss the implications for the management of biodiversity in communities structured by the two mechanisms.},

abstract = {Understanding the impacts of species extinctions on the functioning of food webs is a challenging task because of the complexity of ecological interactions. We report the impacts of experimental species extinctions on the functioning of two food webs of freshwater and marine systems. We used a linear model to partition the variance among the multiple components of the diversity effect (linear group richness, nonlinear group richness, and identity). The identity of each functional group was the best explaining variable of ecosystem functioning for both systems. We assessed the contribution of each functional group in multifunctional space and found that, although the effect of functional group varied across ecosystem functions, some functional groups shared common effects on functions. This study is the first experimental demonstration that functional identity dominates the effects of extinctions on ecosystem functioning, suggesting that generalizations are possible despite the inherent complexity of interactions.

abstract = {Climate change is inducing deep modifications in species geographic ranges worldwide. However, the consequences of such changes on community structure are still poorly understood, particularly the impacts on food-web properties. Here, we propose a new framework, coupling species distribution and trophic models, to predict climate change impacts on food-web structure across the Mediterranean Sea. Sea surface temperature was used to determine the fish climate niches and their future distributions. Body size was used to infer trophic interactions between fish species. Our projections reveal that 54 fish species of 256 endemic and native species included in our analysis would disappear by 2080-2099 from the Mediterranean continental shelf. The number of feeding links between fish species would decrease on 73.4{\%} of the continental shelf. However, the connectance of the overall fish web would increase on average, from 0.26 to 0.29, mainly due to a differential loss rate of feeding links and species richness. This result masks a systematic decrease in predator generality, estimated here as the number of prey species, from 30.0 to 25.4. Therefore, our study highlights large-scale impacts of climate change on marine food-web structure with potential deep consequences on ecosystem functioning. However, these impacts will likely be highly heterogeneous in space, challenging our current understanding of climate change impact on local marine ecosystems.},

abstract = {Climate change is projected to have negative implications for forest ecosystems and their dependent communities and industries. Adaptation studies of forestry practices have focused on maintaining the provisioning of ecosystem services; however, those practices may have implications for climate change mitigation as well by increasing biological sinks or reducing emissions. Assessments of the effectiveness of adaptation strategies to mitigate climate change are therefore needed; however, they have not been done for the world's northern coniferous forests. Diversifying the forest by planting tree species more likely suited to a future climate is a potential adaptation strategy to increase resilience. The efficacy of this strategy to reduce the risks of climate change is uncertain, and other ecosystem services provided by the forest are also likely to be affected. We used a spatially explicit forest landscape modeling framework (LANDIS-II) to simulate the effects of planting a range of native tree species in colder areas than where they are currently planted in a managed temperate coniferous forest landscape in British Columbia, Canada. We investigated impacts on carbon pools, fluxes, tree species diversity, and harvest levels under different climate scenarios for 100 yr (2015–2115) and found that the capacity of our forest landscape to sequester carbon would largely depend on the precipitation rates in the future, rather than on temperature. We further found that, irrespective of the climate prediction model, current planting standards led to relatively low levels of resilience as indicated by carbon fluxes and stocks, net primary productivity (NPP), and species diversity. In contrast, planting a mix of alternative tree species was generally superior in increasing the resilience indicators: carbon stocks and fluxes, NPP, and tree species diversity, but not harvest rates. The second best novel planting regime involved adding Pinus contorta to the stocking standard in three ecoregions; however, that species is susceptible to a high number of insects and pathogens. We conclude that although the capacity of temperate coniferous forest landscapes to sequester carbon in the future is largely dependent on the precipitation regime, negative effects may be counteracted to some extent by increasing resilience through tree species diversity in forests.},

abstract = {Recent work linking community structure and ecosystem function has primarily focused on the effects of local species richness but has neglected the dispersal-dependent processes of community assembly that are ultimately involved in determining community structure and its relation to ecosystems. Here we combine simple consumer-resource competition models and metacommunity theory with discussion of case studies to outline how spatial processes within metacommunities can alter community assembly and modify expectations about how species diversity and composition influence ecosystem attributes at local scales. We argue that when community assembly is strongly limited by dispersal, this can constrain ecosystem functioning by reducing positive selection effects (reducing the probability of the most productive species becoming dominant) even though it may often also enhance complementarity (favoring combinations of species that enhance production even though they may not individually be most productive). Conversely, excess dispersal with strong source-sink relations among heterogeneous habitats can reduce ecosystem functioning by swamping local filters that would normally favor better-suited species. Ecosystem function is thus most likely maximized at intermediate levels of dispersal where both of these effects are minimized. In this scenario, we find that the selection effect is maximized, while complementarity is often reduced and local diversity may often be relatively low. Our synthesis emphasizes that it is the entire set of community assembly processes that affect the functioning of ecosystems, not just the part that determines local species richness.},

abstract = {{\#} 1 Debate continues regarding the ecological impacts of genetically modified (GM) crops and their coexistence with non-GM crops in Europe. In this debate, quantitative predictions of gene dispersal by pollen are necessary, and as a result numerous plot-to-plot gene flow experiments have been performed with various crops. However, plot-to-plot cross-pollination rates (CPR) depend on spatial configuration of plots, implying that (i) they are difficult to compare among experiments and (ii) functions directly fitted on CPR data are inappropriate for predictions in other spatial contexts. {\#} 2 Modelling pollen dispersal via an individual dispersal function (IDF) circumvents these problems by accounting for spatial designs. We detail for oilseed rape how this approach can be used to both estimate an IDF from field data and predict CPR between two neighbouring fields of various sizes and shapes. Predictions were used to investigate the sensitivity of CPR to the family of IDF, the uncertainty in parameter estimates and the effects of field dimensions and isolation distances. {\#} 3 We fitted a range of families of IDF, including several types of tails, on previously published data. The best IDF was a fat-tailed power-law function, meaning frequent long-distance dispersal. {\#} 4 The choice of IDF appeared crucial when predicting CPR between fields, occasionally being even more important than the distance between fields. Width of the source field and depth of the recipient field were next in importance. When approximated CPR were calculated without considering field dimensions, using distance between field centres gave better performance than field margins. {\#} 5 Synthesis and applications. This study demonstrates the value of IDF for quantitative predictions of pollen flow in variable spatial configurations. A spatially explicit model of agro-ecosystems used to define management rules for the commercial release of GM crops in Europe already employs IDF but underestimates long-distance dispersal for oilseed rape. These new parameter estimates will refine the performance of these models. Moreover, the detailed guidelines for estimating an IDF should encourage such statistical analysis of other dispersal data, enabling comparisons of dispersal data obtained for different environments and species and providing new IDF for management models.},

abstract = {Few studies have quantified regional variation in tree mortality, or explored whether species compositional changes or within-species variation are responsible for regional patterns, despite the fact that mortality has direct effects on the dynamics of woody biomass, species composition, stand structure, wood production and forest response to climate change. Using bayesian analysis of over 430,000 tree records from a large eastern US forest database we characterised tree mortality as a function of climate, soils, species and size (stem diameter). We found (1) mortality is U-shaped vs. stem diameter for all 21 species examined; (2) mortality is hump-shaped vs. plot basal area for most species; (3) geographical variation in mortality is substantial, and correlated with several environmental factors; and (4) individual species vary substantially from the combined average in the nature and magnitude of their mortality responses to environmental variation. Regional variation in mortality is therefore the product of variation in species composition combined with highly varied mortality-environment correlations within species. The results imply that variation in mortality is a crucial part of variation in the forest carbon cycle, such that including this variation in models of the global carbon cycle could significantly narrow uncertainty in climate change predictions.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Species interactions are a key component of ecosystems but we generally have an incomplete picture of who-eats-who in a given community. Different techniques have been devised to predict species interactions using theoretical models or abundances. Here, we explore the K nearest neighbour approach, with a special emphasis on recommendation, along with a supervised machine learning technique. Recommenders are algorithms developed for companies like Netflix to predict whether a customer will like a product given the preferences of similar customers. These machine learning techniques are well-suited to study binary ecological interactions since they focus on positive-only data. By removing a prey from a predator, we find that recommenders can guess the missing prey around 50{\%} of the times on the first try, with up to 881 possibilities. Traits do not improve significantly the results for the K nearest neighbour, although a simple test with a supervised learning approach (random forests) show we can predict interactions with high accuracy using only three traits per species. This result shows that binary interactions can be predicted without regard to the ecological community given only three variables: body mass and two variables for the species' phylogeny. These techniques are complementary, as recommenders can predict interactions in the absence of traits, using only information about other species' interactions, while supervised learning algorithms such as random forests base their predictions on traits only but do not exploit other species' interactions. Further work should focus on developing custom similarity measures specialized for ecology to improve the KNN algorithms and using richer data to capture indirect relationships between species.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Here, we explore these differences, apply diverse analyses to more than 1,700 species, and show that recent biological trends match climate change predictions. Global meta-analyses documented significant range shifts averaging 6.1 km per decade towards the poles (or metres per decade upward), and significant mean advancement of spring events by 2.3 days per decade. We define a diagnostic fingerprint of temporal and spatial 'sign-switching' responses uniquely predicted by twentieth century climate trends. Among appropriate long-term/large-scale/multi-species data sets, this diagnostic fingerprint was found for 279 species. This suite of analyses generates 'very high confidence' (as laid down by the IPCC) that climate change is already affecting living systems.},

abstract = {Developing adaptive forest management strategies is essential to maintain the provisioning of forest goods and services (FGS) under future climate change. We assessed how climate change and forest management affect forest development and FGS for a diverse casestudy landscape in Central Europe. Using a process-based forest model (LandClim) we simulated forest dynamics and FGS under a range of climate change and management scenarios in the Black Forest, Germany, which is shaped by various management practices. We focused on the interdependencies between timber production and forest diversity, the most valued FGS in this region. We found that the conversion to more drought-adapted forest types is required to prevent climate change-induced forest dieback and that this conversion must be the target of any adaptive management, especially in areas where monocultures of drought-sensitive Norway spruce (Picea abies) were promoted in the past. Forest conversion takes up to 120 years, however, with past and future adaptive management being the key drivers of timber and forest diversity provision. The conversion of drought-sensitive conifer monocultures maintains timber production in the short term and enhances a range of forest diversity indices. Using uneven-aged forest management that targets a drought-adapted, diverse, and resilient species mixture, high species diversity can be combined with timber production in the long term. Yet, the promotion of mature-stand attributes requires management restrictions. Selecting future adaptive management options thus implies the consideration of trade-offs between forest resource use and environmental objectives, but also the exploitation of synergies between FGS that occur during forest conversion. Lastly, the large impact of past management practices on the spatial heterogeneity of forest dynamics underpins the need to assess FGS provisioning at the landscape scale. {\textcopyright} 2012 by the Ecological Society of America.},

However, recent studies reporting contradictory patterns in species demographic performance at their edges cast doubt on our ability to predict climate change demographic impacts. To understand these inconsistent demographic responses, we need to shift the focus from geographic to climatic edges and analyse how species responses vary with climatic constraints at the edge and species' ecological strategy. Here we parameterised integral projection models with climate and competition effects for 27 tree species using forest inventory data from over 90,000 plots across Europe. Our models estimate size-dependent climatic responses and evaluate their effects on two life trajectory metrics: life span and passage time—the time to grow to a large size. Then we predicted growth, survival, life span and passage time at the hot and dry or cold and wet edges and compared them to their values at the species climatic centre to derive indices of demographic response at the edge. Using these indices, we investigated whether differences in species demographic response between hot and cold edges could be explained by their position along the climate gradient and functional traits related to their climate stress tolerance. We found that at cold and wet edges of European tree species, growth and passage time were constrained, whereas at their hot and dry edges, survival and life span were constrained. Demographic constraints at the edge were stronger for species occurring in extreme conditions, that is, in hot edges of hot-distributed species and cold edges of cold-distributed species. Species leaf nitrogen content was strongly linked to their demographic responses at the edge. In contrast, we found only weak links with wood density, leaf size and xylem vulnerability to embolism. Synthesis. Our study presents a more complicated picture than previously thought with demographic responses that differ between hot and cold edges. Predictions of climate change impacts should be refined to include edge and species characteristics.},

abstract = {The number of tree species that coexist on a hectare scale rises by more than two orders of magnitude from boreal to tropical forests. Jacob Usinowicz and colleagues assess the extent to which latitudinal differences in competition between species shape this gradient, using seed production and seedling recruitment data from ten forests spanning the tropics to the boreal zone. They show that the longer and more stable growing seasons in the tropics permit greater differentiation between species in terms of the seasonal timing of reproduction. This asynchrony in the timing of tree recruitment reduces the degree of competition between species in the tropics, relative to forests at higher latitudes, thereby increasing the potential for species coexistence. The findings highlight the contribution that local-scale ecological processes can make to global-scale gradients in biodiversity.},

abstract = {Many studies in recent years have investigated the effects of climate change on the future of biodiversity. In this review, we first examine the different possible effects of climate change that can operate at individual, population, species, community, ecosystem and biome scales, notably showing that species can respond to climate change challenges by shifting their climatic niche along three non-exclusive axes: time (e.g. phenology), space (e.g. range) and self (e.g. physiology). Then, we present the principal specificities and caveats of the most common approaches used to estimate future biodiversity at global and sub-continental scales and we synthesise their results. Finally, we highlight several challenges for future research both in theoretical and applied realms. Overall, our review shows that current estimates are very variable, depending on the method, taxonomic group, biodiversity loss metrics, spatial scales and time periods considered. Yet, the majority of models indicate alarming consequences for biodiversity, with the worst-case scenarios leading to extinction rates that would qualify as the sixth mass extinction in the history of the earth.},

abstract = {Scale transition theory is a framework for predicting regional population dynamics from local process functions and estimates of spatial heterogeneity. Using this framework, we estimated regional scale functional responses for a benthic predator-prey system in the Baltic Sea. Functional responses were based on laboratory experiments or field observations of stomach contents, and prey densities measured at a local scale (0.1 m(2)) or a regional scale (300 km(2)). Laboratory data overestimated consumption at high prey densities, whereas predictions based on local scale data tallied closely with consumption observed at the regional scale. The predicted regional functional response was different for increasing and decreasing prey densities, reflecting that predator and prey densities, as well as the covariance between them, exhibit oscillatory dynamics. We conclude that it is important to validate laboratory data with small-scale field observations and that scale transition is a powerful tool for scaling-up process functions in heterogeneous systems.},

abstract = {Trawling has been reported worldwide to alter seabed structure, and thus benthic habitats and ecosystems. Usually, a decrease in species richness and biomass is observed, and community structure is modified towards more opportunistic species. The Gulf of St Lawrence (Canada) has been intensely exploited since the 17th century, including net, longline, dredge and trawl fishing activities. Recently, the collapse of groundfish stocks induced a shift in fishing practices toward shrimp trawling, which is currently considered a sustainable fishing activity in the region. However, no long-term study has evaluated the potential effects of trawling disturbances on benthic mega-invertebrates. We investigated whether shrimp trawling had long- (ca. 20 years), mid- (ca. 10 years), and short-term (ca. 4 years) impacts on benthic mega-invertebrate taxa richness, biomass, and community structure. Scientific and fishery trawling data analyses showed that no significant long-, mid-, or short-term effect was detected on taxa richness. Significant but weak effects on biomass and community structure were detected at the mesoscale, i.e. at the scale of fishing grounds. In this long-exploited ecosystem, we suggest that a critical level of disturbance was attained by the first gear passages, which occurred decades ago and had irreversible impacts on the seabed by removing vulnerable taxa and structures that provided three-dimensional habitats. It is likely that benthic communities have subsequently reached a disturbed state of equilibrium on which current trawling disturbance has limited or no further impacts.},

abstract = {A long-standing theory, originating with Darwin, suggests that abiotic forces set species range limits at high latitude, high elevation, and other abiotically 'stressful' areas, while species interactions set range limits in apparently more benign regions. This theory is of considerable importance for both basic and applied ecology, and while it is often assumed to be a ubiquitous pattern, it has not been clearly defined or broadly tested. We review tests of this idea and dissect how the strength of species interactions must vary across stress gradients to generate the predicted pattern. We conclude by suggesting approaches to better test this theory, which will deepen our understanding of the forces that determine species ranges and govern responses to climate change. Both climate and species interactions set species range limits, but it is unclear when each is most important.An old hypothesis, first proposed by Darwin, suggests that abiotic factors should be key drivers of limits in abiotically stressful areas, and species interactions should dominate in abiotically benign areas.Four distinct mechanisms, ranging from per-capita effects to community-level synergies, could result in differential importance of species interactions across stress gradients.These mechanisms, operating alone or in tandem, can result in patterns consistent or inconsistent with Darwin's hypothesis, depending on the strength and direction of effects.The most robust test of this hypothesis, not to date performed in any study, is to analyze how sensitive range limit location is to changes in the strength of one or more species interactions and also to abiotic stressors.},

Nolan et al. looked at documented vegetational and climatic changes at almost 600 sites worldwide since the last glacial maximum 21,000 years ago. From this, they determined vegetation responses to temperature changes of 4° to 7°C. They went on to estimate the extent of ecosystem changes under current similar (albeit more rapid) scenarios of warming. Without substantial mitigation efforts, terrestrial ecosystems are at risk of major transformation in composition and structure. Science , this issue p. [920][1] Impacts of global climate change on terrestrial ecosystems are imperfectly constrained by ecosystem models and direct observations. Pervasive ecosystem transformations occurred in response to warming and associated climatic changes during the last glacial-to-interglacial transition, which was comparable in magnitude to warming projected for the next century under high-emission scenarios. We reviewed 594 published paleoecological records to examine compositional and structural changes in terrestrial vegetation since the last glacial period and to project the magnitudes of ecosystem transformations under alternative future emission scenarios. Our results indicate that terrestrial ecosystems are highly sensitive to temperature change and suggest that, without major reductions in greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere, terrestrial ecosystems worldwide are at risk of major transformation, with accompanying disruption of ecosystem services and impacts on biodiversity.

The main goal of the present work was to describe the demographic structure of a natural A. angustifolia population. Therefore, the population studied was divided into four classes based on stage and gender: regeneration, juveniles, males and females. The diametric and height structures, sexual ratio, spatial and dependence patterns were evaluated. The results demonstrated that there was a small regeneration ratio and the sexual ratio was around 1:1, as previously expected for the species. In the spatial pattern analysis, aggregation groups appear in all classes studied. The regeneration showed clusters that do not seem to be associated to adult specimens. The natural regeneration occurs, but in low density under forest conditions.},

abstract = {Spatial fingerprints of climate change on tree species distribution are usually detected at latitudinal or altitudinal extremes (arctic or alpine tree line), where temperatures play a key role in tree species distribution. However, early detection of recent climate change effects on tree species distribution across the overall temperature gradient remains poorly explored. Within French mountain forests, we investigated altitudinal distribution differences between seedling ({\textless} 50 cm tall and {\textgreater} 1 yr old) and adult ({\textgreater} 8 m tall) life stages for 17 European tree taxa, encompassing the entire forest elevation range from lowlands to the subalpine vegetation belt (50-2250 m a.s.l.) and spanning the latitudinal gradient from northern temperate to southern Mediterranean forests. We simultaneously identified seedlings and adults within the same vegetation plots. These twin observations gave us the equivalent of exactly paired plots in space with seedlings reflecting a response to the studied warm period (1986-2006) and adults reflecting a response to a former and cooler period. For 13 out of 17 species, records of the mean altitude of presence at the seedling life stage are higher than that at the adult life stage. The low altitudinal distribution limit of occurrences at the seedling life stage is, on average, 29 m higher than that at the adult life stage which is significant. The high altitudinal distribution limit also shows a similar trend but which is not significant. Complementary analyses using modelling techniques and focusing on the optimum elevation (i.e. the central position inside distribution ranges) have confirmed differences between life stages altitudinal distribution. Seedlings optima are mostly higher than adults optimum, reaching, on average, a 69 m gap. This overall trend showing higher altitudinal distribution at the seedling life stage in comparison to the adult one suggests a main driver of change highly related to elevation, such as climate warming that occurs during the studied period. Other drivers of change that could play an important role across elevation or act at more specific scales are also discussed as potential contributors to explain our results.},

abstract = {Models of population divergence and speciation are often based on the assumption that differences between populations are due to genetic factors, and that phenotypic change is due to natural selection. It is equally plausible that some of the differences among populations are due to phenotypic plasticity. We use the metaphor of the adaptive landscape to review the role of phenotypic plasticity in driving genetic evolution. Moderate levels of phenotypic plasticity are optimal in permitting population survival in a new environment and in bringing populations into the realm of attraction of an adaptive peak. High levels of plasticity may increase the probability of population persistence but reduce the likelihood of genetic change, because the plastic response itself places the population close to a peak. Moderate levels of plasticity arise whenever multiple traits, some of which are plastic and others not, form a composite trait involved in the adaptive response. For example, altered behaviours may drive selection on morphology and physiology. Because there is likely to be a considerable element of chance in which behaviours become established, behavioural change followed by morphological and physiological evolution may be a potent force in driving evolution in novel directions. We assess the role of phenotypic plasticity in stimulating evolution by considering two examples from birds: (i) the evolution of red and yellow plumage coloration due to carotenoid consumption; and (ii) the evolution of foraging behaviours on islands. Phenotypic plasticity is widespread in nature and may speed up, slow down, or have little effect on evolutionary change. Moderate levels of plasticity may often facilitate genetic evolution but careful analyses of individual cases are needed to ascertain whether plasticity has been essential or merely incidental to population differentiation.},

This understanding is crucial, not only for improving ecological knowledge, but also for managing properly the genetic diversity of threatened and endangered populations. For nearly 80 years, population geneticists have investigated how physiognomy and other land- scape features have influenced genetic variation within and between populations. They have relied on sampling populations that have been identified beforehand because most population genetics methods have required discrete populations. However, a newapproach has emerged for analyzing spatial genetic data without requiring that discrete populations be identified in advance. This approach, landscape genetics, promises to facilitate our understanding of how geographical and environmental features structure genetic variation at both the population and individual levels, and has impli- cations for ecology, evolution and conservation biology. It differs from other genetic approaches, such as phylo- geography, in that it tends to focus on processes at finer spatial and temporal scales. Here, we discuss, from a population genetic perspective, the current tools avail- able for conducting studies of landscape genetics.},

abstract = {The paradox of enrichment has been studied almost exclusively within communities or metacommunities, without explicit nutrient dynamics. Yet local recycling of materials from enriched ecosystems may affect the stability of connected ecosystems. Here we study the effect of nutrient, detritus, producer, and consumer spatial flows-combined with changes in regional enrichment-on the stability of a metaecosystem model. We considered both spatially homogeneous and heterogeneous enrichment. We found that nutrient and detritus spatial flows are destabilizing, whereas producer or consumer spatial flows are either neutral or stabilizing. We noticed that detritus spatial flows have only a weak impact on stability. Our study reveals that heterogeneity no longer stabilizes well-connected systems when accounting for explicit representation of nutrient dynamics. We also found that intermediate consumer diffusion could lead to multiple equilibria in strongly enriched metaecosystems. Stability can emerge from a top-down control allowing the storage of materials into inorganic form, a mechanism never documented before. In conclusion, local enrichment can be stabilized if spatial flows are strong enough to efficiently redistribute the local excess of enrichment to unfertile ecosystems. However, high regional enrichment can be dampened only by intermediate consumer diffusion rates.},

abstract = {Forest responses to climate change will depend on demographic impacts in the context of competition. Current models used to predict species responses, termed climate envelope models (CEMs), are controversial, because (i) calibration and prediction are based on correlations in space (CIS) between species abundance and climate, rather than responses to climate change over time (COT), and (ii) they omit competition. To determine the relative importance of COT, CIS, and competition for light, we applied a longitudinal analysis of 27 000 individual trees over 6-18 years subjected to experimental and natural variation in risk factors. Sensitivities and climate and resource tracking identify which species are vulnerable to these risk factors and in what ways. Results show that responses to COT differ from those predicted based on CIS. The most important impact is the effect of spring temperature on fecundity, rather than any input variable on growth or survival. Of secondary importance is growing season moisture. Species in the genera Pinus, Ulmus, Magnolia, and Fagus are particularly vulnerable to climate variation. However, the effect of competition on growth and mortality risk exceeds the effects of climate variation in space or time for most species. Because sensitivities to COT and competition are larger than CIS, current models miss the most important effects. By directly comparing sensitivity to climate in time and space, together with competition, the approach identifies which species are sensitive to climate change and why, including the heretofore overlooked impact on fecundity.},

abstract = {Forest ecosystems in the United States (U.S.) are facing major challenges such as climate change, exotic species invasions, and landscape fragmentation. It is widely believed that forest composition in the eastern U.S. is transitioning from shade-intolerant, fire-tolerant species to shade-tolerant, fire-intolerant species, but most evidence is anecdotal or localized. No comprehensive studies exist to quantify the shifts in forest composition across multiple genera at a regional scale. Here, we examined the genus-level compositional changes in eastern U.S. forests to: (1) quantify the extent and magnitude of this transition, and (2) assess the influence of shade and fire tolerance traits on abundance change. Genus-level data were compiled from the Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) database across 37 states in the eastern U.S. for the last three decades. We analyzed shifts in forest composition with three metrics—stem density, basal area, and importance value—for 10 of the most abundant genera (Acer, Betula, Carya, Fraxinus, Nyssa, Pinus, Populus, Prunus, Quercus, and Ulmus). In addition, we estimated density-weighted fire and shade tolerances for each genus using species-level published data, assessed the shifts in spatial patterns of these traits, and analyzed the associations between these traits and county-level abundance changes. In general, Acer, Fraxinus, Pinus, and Prunus increased in abundance during the study period. Acer experienced the largest increase in abundance across the study area. In contrast, Carya, Nyssa, Quercus and Ulmus decreased in abundance in the majority of the study region, with Quercus having the largest and most extensive decline. Although density-weighted shade and fire tolerances were correlated at the genus level, shade tolerance was a better predictor of genus-level abundance change than fire tolerance. Traits of fire and shade tolerance are not always interchangeable when used to predict the dynamics of a genus, and management decision making based on traits should focus at the species level when possible. Our analyses provide evidence that forest composition has shifted in the last three decades in the eastern United States across multiple genera, and the shifts are more closely related to species' shade tolerance than fire tolerance.},

abstract = {Peach palm (Bactris gasipaes) is cultivated by many indigenous and traditional communities from Amazonia to Central America for its edible fruits, and is currently important for its heart-of-palm. The objective of this study was to investigate the mating system of peach palm, as this is important for conservation and breeding. Eight microsatellite loci were used to genotype 24 open-pollinated progenies from three populations of the Pampa Hermosa landrace maintained in a progeny trial for genetic improvement. Both the multi-locus outcrossing rates (0.95 to 0.99) and the progeny level multi-locus outcrossing rates (0.9 to 1.0) were high, indicating that peach palm is predominantly allogamous. The outcrossing rates among relatives were significantly different from zero (0.101 to 0.202), providing evidence for considerable biparental inbreeding within populations, probably due to farmers planting seeds of a small number of open-pollinated progenies in the same plot. The correlations of paternity estimates were low (0.051 to 0.112), suggesting a large number of pollen sources (9 to 20) participating in pollination of individual fruit bunches. Effective population size estimates suggest that current germplasm collections are insufficient for long-term ex situ conservation. As with most underutilized crops, on farm conservation is the most important component of an integrated conservation strategy.},

Long-term global change manipulative$\backslash$nexperiments, especially in high-priority ecosystems such as tropical$\backslash$nforests and high-latitude regions, are essential to maximize information$\backslash$ngain concerning future states of the earth system.

Gene flow from the outside plays a pivotal role in the fate of these marginal populations. It has been proposed that spatial fragmentation and perceived geographic isolation do not necessarily reflect a loss of genetic connectivity in tree species. However, the spatial limits of long-distance gene flow, as well as its magnitude and impact, are still generally unknown. In the present study, we analyzed long-distance pollen-mediated gene flow into an isolated relict stand consisting of 7 individuals of Quercus robur L. based on a total sample of 177 trees and 9 microsatellite loci. We show that pollen-mediated gene flow across more than 80 km in this wind-pollinated tree species contributed at least 35{\%} of all successful pollinations in the investigated isolated and small oak stand at the eastern limit of the species' distribution. The observed pollen immigration shaped the genetic diversity of acorn progenies in the stand and might explain the comparably high genetic diversity in the persisting adult population.},

The allele frequency differences between consecutive cohorts were significant in all four populations. There were no indications of natural selection, and we conclude that random genetic drift is the most likely cause of temporal allele frequency shifts at the loci examined. Effective population sizes were estimated from observed allele frequency shifts among cohorts, taking into consideration the demographic characteristics of each population. The estimated effective sizes of the four populations range from 52 to 480 individuals, and we conclude that the effective size of natural brown trout popula- tions may differ considerably among lakes that are similar in size and other apparent characteristics. In spite of their different effective sizes all four populations have similar levels of genetic variation (average heterozygosity) indicating that excessive loss of genetic variability has been retarded, most likely because of gene flow among neighboring populations.},

abstract = {Recent global land-use changes have led to reductions in many herbaceous plant species in semi-natural grassland landscapes. Changes in management frequency and intensity are known to cause declines in plant populations. However, little is known about the impact of changes in the timing of management practices on the genetic diversity as well as the reproductive success of rare semi-natural grassland species. We determined the suitable management (mowing) timing for Vincetoxicum pycnostelma Kitag. (Apocynaceae; Asclepiadoideae), an endangered summer- and autumn-blooming semi-natural grassland herb. We examined 15 V. pycnostelma populations to assess the effects of mowing timing on the genetic diversity of each population using nine microsatellite markers and on pollination and reproductive success. Pollination success was not affected by flowering timing. Mowing during the mid- to late flowering and fruiting periods of V. pycnostelma (July–September) had a significant negative effect on the number of inflorescences and total fruits produced, whereas mowing before flowering and growing periods (April, May and November–March) had positive effects on the number of inflorescences and fruits, respectively. Furthermore, mowing during the mid- to late flowering and fruiting periods also caused a significant decrease in genetic diversity. Our results demonstrated that mowing events during the mid- to late flowering and fruiting periods caused significant declines in the genetic diversity and/or reproductive success of V. pycnostelma. By contrast, mowing before flowering periods significantly enhanced reproductive success. To conserve semi-natural grassland herb diversity, mowing should be avoided during seasons when the flowering and fruiting periods of many endangered species overlap.},

abstract = {Adaptation to local resource availability depends on responses in growth rate and nutrient acquisition. The growth rate hypothesis (GRH) suggests that growing fast should impair competitive abilities for phosphorus and nitrogen due to high demand for biosynthesis. However, in microorganisms, size influ-ences both growth and uptake rates, which may mask trade-offs and instead generate a positive relationship between these traits (size hypothesis, SH). Here, we evolved a gradient of maximum growth rate (m max) from a single bacterium ancestor to test the relationship among m max , competitive ability for nutrients and cell size, while controlling for evolutionary history. We found a strong positive correlation between m max and competitive ability for phosphorus, associated with a trade-off between m max and cell size: strains selected for high m max were smaller and better competitors for phosphorus. Our results strongly support the SH, while the trade-offs expected under GRH were not apparent. Beyond plasticity, unicellular populations can respond rapidly to selection pressure through joint evolution of their size and maximum growth rate. Our study stresses that physiological links between these traits tightly shape the evolution of competitive strategies.},

abstract = {Plant competition may intensify with climate warming, but whether this will occur equally for conspecific and heterospecific competition remains unknown. Competitive shifts have the potential to instigate community change because the relative strengths of conspecific and heterospecific negative density dependence mediate the stabilizing mechanisms underpinning species coexistence. We examined a mature temperate forest to assess both direct and indirect climate effects at multiple scales: individual species, interspecies relationships, and community stability mechanisms. Our coupled approach (1) quantified tree mortality risk dependence on the interactive effects of competition, climatic water deficit, snowpack, and soil moisture for 28,913 trees over 8 years (3149 mortalities), then (2) used a climate-projection ensemble to forecast changes in conspecific and heterospecific competition from 2020 to 2100. We predict that projected climate warming will destabilize the foundational forest community by increasing the strength of heterospecific competition at a greater rate and to a greater degree than conspecific competition for four of five abundant tree species, particularly on dry microsites. Modeling showed that these findings were most pronounced after the year 2038, at which point snowpacks were projected to be too small to ameliorate the effects of drought on competitive interactions. Our finding that heterospecific competition is more sensitive than conspecific competition to climate warming may indicate the impending loss of ecosystem functioning. We join the growing body of work showing a predominance of indirect drought effects, yet coupled climate models still fail to consider how changing community dynamics may impact forest cover and, in turn, disrupt forest–climate carbon feedbacks. Ecosystems sharing characteristics with our example forest—those with low species richness and therefore a limited biodiversity insurance effect—may be similarly vulnerable to climate-mediated destabilization. In such communities, increased heterospecific competition among even a small number of species can more easily destabilize communities without recourse from redundant species. This study of an overlooked but vital mechanism of community change can be adapted by research in a range of ecosystems to improve the understanding of climate change consequences.},

abstract = {The above-ground biomass (AGB) of tropical forests is a crucial variable for ecologists, biogeochemists, foresters and policymakers. Tree inventories are an efficient way of assessing forest carbon stocks and emissions to the atmosphere during deforestation. To make correct inferences about long-term changes in biomass stocks, it is essential to know the uncertainty associated with AGB estimates, yet this uncertainty is rarely evaluated carefully. Here, we quantify four types of uncertainty that could lead to statistical error in AGB estimates: (i) error due to tree measurement; (ii) error due to the choice of an allometric model relating AGB to other tree dimensions; (iii) sampling uncertainty, related to the size of the study plot; (iv) representativeness of a network of small plots across a vast forest landscape. In previous studies, these sources of error were reported but rarely integrated into a consistent framework. We estimate all four terms in a 50 hectare (ha, where 1 ha = 10(4) m2) plot on Barro Colorado Island, Panama, and in a network of 1 ha plots scattered across central Panama. We find that the most important source of error is currently related to the choice of the allometric model. More work should be devoted to improving the predictive power of allometric models for biomass.},

We found (i) that the sapling age structures showed a progressive decrease in the establishment of maple relative to beech starting about 40 years ago, (ii) a change in the species growth hierarchy that started in the 1980s due to increasing radial growth of beech, (iii) that this growth trend is negligible for both maple and beech when we account for size and suppression status, and finally (iv) that the growth trend appears to be independent of present soil conditions. These results contrast with previous studies conducted at the adult stage that reported a growth decline for maple. We conclude that this change in recruitment dynamics is not related to growth, and consequently, further studies investigating this phenomenon should concentrate on establishment and survival.},

Despite increasing prominence and shared goals, their compatibility and complementarity have received little attention. This paucity of overlap not only presents an obstacle to newcomers to the field, but it also precludes further conceptual advances at their interface. Here, we present a synthetic treatment of the two frameworks. We review their main concepts and explore their theoretical and empirical relationship, focusing on how the resource supply ratio, impact niche, and requirement niche of contemporary niche theory translate into the stabilizing and equalizing processes of modern coexistence theory. We show for a general consumer-resource model that varying resource supply ratios reflects an equalizing process; varying impact niche overlap reflects a stabilizing process; and varying requirement niche overlap may be both stabilizing and equalizing, but has no qualitative effect on coexistence. These generalisations provide mechanistic insight into modern coexistence theory, while also clarifying the role of contemporary niche theory's impacts and requirements in mediating coexistence. From an empirical perspective, we recommend a hierarchical approach, in which quantification of the strength of stabilizing mechanisms is used to guide more focused investigation into the underlying niche factors determining species coexistence. Future research that considers alternative assumptions, including different forms of species interaction, spatio-temporal heterogeneity, and priority effects, would facilitate a more complete synthesis of the two frameworks.},

abstract = {Araucaria angustifolia is an endangered tropical/subtropical coniferous of great interest for conservation due its economical, ecological, and social value. Only 3{\%} of original Araucaria forests remain, which are generally confined to small forest fragments. Forest fragmentation can have serious consequences on genetic process in tree population, affecting long-term fitness and adaptability. To investigate the effects of forest fragmentation on genetic diversity and the structure of A. angustifolia populations, the genetic diversity of eight microsatellite loci was compared in four small fragmented populations ({\textless}22 ha), four tree groups (five to 11 trees) occurring in pastures and in three plots in a large continuous population. The clearest effect of fragmentation was the loss of rare alleles (p=0.05) in fragmented populations (19.4{\%} to 47.2{\%}) and intermediate frequency (0.05{\textless}p {\textless}= 0.25) and rare alleles (p=0.05) in tree groups (19{\%} to 86.1{\%}) in comparison to continuous populations.

Evidence that forest fragments have experienced a recent bottleneck was confirmed in at least two studied fragments. The implications of the results for conservation of the fragmented A. angustifolia populations are discussed.},

abstract = {Species distribution models are a fundamental tool in ecology, conservation biology, and biogeography and typically identify potential species distributions using static phenomenological models. We demonstrate the importance of complementing these popular models with spatially explicit, dynamic mechanistic models that link potential and realized distributions. We develop general grid-based, pattern-oriented spread models incorporating three mechanisms--plant population growth, local dispersal, and long-distance dispersal--to predict broadscale spread patterns in heterogeneous landscapes. We use the model to examine the spread of the invasive Celastrus orbiculatus (Oriental bittersweet) by Sturnus vulgaris (European starling) across northeastern North America. We find excellent quantitative agreement with historical spread records over the last century that are critically linked to the geometry of heterogeneous landscapes and each of the explanatory mechanisms considered. Spread of bittersweet before 1960 was primarily driven by high growth rates in developed and agricultural landscapes, while subsequent spread was mediated by expansion into deciduous and coniferous forests. Large, continuous patches of coniferous forests may substantially impede invasion. The success of C. orbiculatus and its potential mutualism with S. vulgaris suggest troubling predictions for the spread of other invasive, fleshy-fruited plant species across northeastern North America.},

It is suggested that (1) the major limiting resources for mesic terrestrial habitats are often a soil resource, especially nitrogen, and light; (2) these resources are naturally inversely related, the habitats with poor soils having high-light availability and the habitats with rich soils having low-light availability; (3) the life history of a plant should depend on the point along the soil-resource: light gradient at which the plant is a superior competitor; and (4) primary succession and secondary succession on poor soils result from a temporal gradient in the relative availabilities of a limiting soil resource and light. If, as hypothesized, plants specialized on low-nutrient habitats are relatively short in height, short-lived, and fast growing, and if they reproduce early in life compared to plants dominant when light at the soil surface is limiting, these life history differences could explain the similarity of secondary succession on rich soils to primary succession and secondary succession on poor soils.},

A modified version of the JABOWA-FORET model of the dynamic processes of establishment, growth, and death of forest trees is used in a spatially explicit framework to elucidate differences in the effects of both spatial structure and spatial processes. In cases with and without climatic change, the effects of including random or structured fragmentation and successively lower dispersal probabilities (increased chance of long-distance dispersal) are examined in simulation experiments. The exclusion of very low dispersal probability (p {\textless} 0.001) has an important effect on species richness. Barriers and random fragmentation also lower diversity. Climatic change has little effect on diversity alone or in addition to fragmentation; changes in composition result. These results indicate that rare events, especially of the type seldom recorded in observations of seed dispersal, are extremely important. The results of our simulation experiments indicate that model scale must be addressed in more detail.},

abstract = {Aim: Climate change causes major shifts in species distributions, reshuffling community composition and favouring warm-adapted species (“thermophilization”). The tree community response is likely to be affected by major disturbances, such as fire and harvest. Here, we quantify the relative contributions of climate change and disturbances to temporal shifts in tree composition over the last decades and evaluate whether disturbances accelerate community thermophilization. Location: Qu{\'{e}}bec, Canada. Time period: 1970–2016. Taxa studied: Trees. Methods: Using 6,281 forest inventory plots, we quantified temporal changes in species composition between a historical (1970–1980) and a contemporary period (2000–2016) by measuring temporal $\beta$-diversity, gains and losses. The effects of climate and disturbances on temporal $\beta$-diversity were quantified using multiple regressions and variation partitioning. We compared how community indices of species temperature preference (CTI) and shade tolerance (CSI) changed for forests that experienced different levels of disturbance. We quantified the contribution of species gains and losses to change in CTI. Results: Temporal $\beta$-diversity was mainly driven by disturbances, with historical harvesting as the most important predictor. Despite the prevailing influence of disturbances, we revealed a significant thermophilization ($\Delta$CTI = +.03 °C/decade) throughout forests in Qu{\'{e}}bec. However, this shift in community composition was weakly explained by climate change and considerably slower than the rate of warming (+.14 °C/decade). Importantly, thermophilization was amplified by moderate disturbances (+.044 °C/decade), almost a threefold increase compared with minor disturbances (+.015 °C/decade). The gains and losses of a few tree species contributed to this community-level shift. Conclusions: Our study provides evidence that disturbances can strongly modify tree community responses to climate change. Moderate disturbances, such as harvesting, might reduce competition and facilitate gains of warm-adapted species, which then accelerate thermophilization of tree communities under climate change. Although accelerated by disturbances, community thermophilization was driven by the gains and losses of a small number of species, notably gains of maples.},

abstract = {Community ecology is tasked with the considerable challenge of predicting the structure, and properties, of emerging ecosystems. It requires the ability to understand how and why species interact, as this will allow the development of mechanism-based predictive models, and as such to better characterize how ecological mechanisms act locally on the existence of inter-specific interactions. Here we argue that the current conceptualization of species interaction networks is ill-suited for this task. Instead, we propose that future research must start to account for the intrinsic variability of species interactions, then scale up from here onto complex networks. This can be accomplished simply by recognizing that there exists intra-specific variability, in traits or properties related to the establishment of species interactions. By shifting the scale towards population-based processes, we show that this new approach will improve our predictive ability and mechanistic understanding of how species interact over large spatial or temporal scales. SIGNIFICANCE: Although species interactions are the backbone of ecological communities, we have little insights on how Synthesis (and why) they vary through space and time. In this article, we build on existing empirical literature to show that the same species may happen to interact in different ways when their local abundances vary, their trait distribution changes, or when the environment affects either of these factors. We discuss how these findings can be integrated in existing frameworks for the analysis and simulation of species interactions. Interactions},

Using a dataset of long-term (1958-2009) observations on 1,680 permanent sample plots from undisturbed natural forests in western Canada, we found that tree demographic rates have changed markedly over the last five decades. We observed a widespread, significant increase in tree mortality, a significant decrease in tree growth, and a similar but weaker trend of decreasing recruitment. However, these changes varied widely across tree size, forest age, ecozones, and species. We found that competition was the primary factor causing the long-term changes in tree mortality, growth, and recruitment. Regional climate had a weaker yet still significant effect on tree mortality, but little effect on tree growth and recruitment. This finding suggests that internal community-level processes-more so than external climatic factors-are driving forest dynamics.},

abstract = {In the Mediterranean region most climatic forecasts predict longer and more intense drought periods that can affect tree growth and mortality over broad geographic regions. One of the silvicultural treatments that has gained currency to lessen the impacts of climatic change is the reduction of stand density by thinning. However, we lack information on how the response of forest stands to different thinning treatments will be affected by climate change, and on the post-thinning temporal dynamics of water balance, specifically blue and green water. We adopted a modelling approach to explore the long-term effects of different thinning intensities on forest dynamics and water balance under climate change scenarios, coupling an individual-based model of forest dynamics (SORTIE-ND) with a mechanistic model of soil moisture dynamics and plant drought stress. We used as a case study three Scots pine plots across a gradient of climatic conditions, and we assessed the effect of site, three climatic scenarios and eight thinning intensities on tree growth, stand productivity, tree drought stress and blue water. The best thinning intensity in terms of stand productivity was obtained when between 20 and 40{\%} of the basal area was removed, whereas the final stand stock rapidly decreased at higher thinning intensities. Moreover, the decrease in final basal area occurred at lower thinning intensities the drier the site conditions. Moderate and heavy thinnings ({\textgreater}30{\%}) doubled basal area increment (BAI) of the following years in all the plots, although the effect vanished after 30–40 years, independently of the site and climate scenario. As expected, thinning was simulated to have an overall positive effect on the blue water yield and tree water status, which increased and also tended to last longer for higher thinning intensities. However, the magnitude of this effect on tree water status was most dependent on the site and climatic scenario, as drier conditions generally raised stronger and longer lasting reductions in drought stress for a given thinning intensity. Furthermore, our results highlight the existence of a site- and climate-dependent trade-off between the gain in stand productivity and the improvement in tree water status obtained by thinning, particularly for moderate or heavy thinning intensities. Our simulations suggest that thinning is a useful management tool to mitigate climate change but strongly argue against the application of general recipes across sites and appeals for carefully taking into consideration local climatic trajectories for management planning.},

The maintenance of genetic diversity and functional connectivity in a landscape context is probably key to long-term conservation of remnant populations. We measured the genetic diversity in seedlings and adults of tree Copaifera langsdorffii and evaluated whether edge and density-dependent effects drive natural regeneration in a set of very small and degraded Brazilian Atlantic forest fragments. We evaluated the role of small remnants in the conservation of genetic diversity in a hyper fragmented landscape and discuss the challenge of long-term population sustainability of such altered habitats. High genetic diversity in adults indicated these fragments are valuable targets for C. langsdorffii in situ conservation, but both genetic diversity and divergence among patches decreased in seedlings. In our landscape, regeneration increased as it neared edges and adults; suggesting this population is resilient to fragmentation. However, at a broader scale, current levels of gene flow have not been sufficient to prevent the loss of genetic diversity across generations. Restoration plans, even at a small scale, are necessary to promote fragment connectivity and spatially expand opportunities for the fairly restricted gene flow observed in this severely fragmented Brazilian Atlantic forest region.},

abstract = {Interaction networks are central elements of ecological systems and have very complex structures. Historically, much effort has focused on niche-mediated processes to explain these structures, while an emerging consensus posits that both niche and neutral mechanisms simultaneously shape many features of ecological communities. However, the study of interaction networks still lacks a comprehensive neutral theory. Here we present a neutral model of predator-prey interactions and analyze the structural characteristics of the simulated networks. We find that connectance values (complexity) and complexity-diversity relationships of neutral networks are close to those observed in empirical bipartite networks. High nestedness and low modularity values observed in neutral networks fall in the range of those from empirical antagonist bipartite networks. Our results suggest that, as an alternative to niche-mediated processes that induce incompatibility between species ("niche forbidden links"), neutral processes create "neutral forbidden links" due to uneven species abundance distributions and the low probability of interaction between rare species. Neutral trophic networks must be seen as the missing endpoint of a continuum from niche to purely stochastic approaches of community organization.},

abstract = {Integral projection models (IPMs) have a number of advantages over matrix-model approaches for analyzing size-structured population dynamics, because the latter require parameter estimates for each age or stage transition. However, IPMs still require appropriate data. Typically they are parameterized using individual-scale relationships between body size and demographic rates, but these are not always available. We present an alternative approach for estimating demographic parameters from time series of size-structured survey data using a Bayesian state-space IPM (SSIPM). By fitting an IPM in a state-space framework, we estimate unknown parameters and explicitly account for process and measurement error in a dataset to estimate the underlying process model dynamics. We tested our method by fitting SSIPMs to simulated data; the model fit the simulated size distributions well and estimated unknown demographic parameters accurately. We then illustrated our method using nine years of annual surveys of the density and size distribution of two fish species (blue rockfish, Sebastes mystinus, and gopher rockfish, S. carnatus) at seven kelp forest sites in California. The SSIPM produced reasonable fits to the data, and estimated fishing rates for both species that were higher than our Bayesian prior estimates based on coast-wide stock assessment estimates of harvest. That improvement reinforces the value of being able to estimate demographic parameters from local-scale monitoring data. We highlight a number of key decision points in SSIPM development (e.g., open vs. closed demography, number of particles in the state-space filter) so that users can apply the method to their own datasets.},

abstract = {Increases in tree mortality rates have been highlighted in different biomes over the past decades. However, disentangling the effects of climate change on the temporal increase in tree mortality from those of management and forest dynamics remains a challenge. Using a modelling approach taking tree and stand characteristics into account, we sought to evaluate the impact of climate change on background mortality for the most common European tree species. We focused on background mortality, which is the mortality observed in a stand in the absence of abrupt disturbances, to avoid confusion with mortality events unrelated to long-term changes in temperature and rainfall. We studied 372 974 trees including 7312 dead trees from forest inventory data surveyed across France between 2009 and 2015. Factors related to competition, stand characteristics, management intensity, and site conditions were the expected preponderant drivers of mortality. Taking these main drivers into account, we detected a climate change signal on 45{\%} of the 43 studied species, explaining an average 6{\%} of the total modelled mortality. For 18 out of the 19 species sensitive to climate change, we evidenced greater mortality with increasing temperature or decreasing rainfall. By quantifying the mortality excess linked to the current climate change for European temperate forest tree species, we provide new insights into forest vulnerability that will prove useful for adapting forest management to future conditions.},

abstract = {There is an increasing awareness that not only area and isolation, but also the characteristics of the landscape surrounding habitat patches influence population persistence and species diversity in fragmented landscapes. In this study, we examine the effects of grassland fragmentation and land use in the landscape matrix (on a 2 km scale) on species richness of plants, butterflies, bees and hoverflies. These organisms were studied in replicated remnant patches of different sizes and isolation, embedded in landscapes dominated either by forest, arable land or a mix of these. We found positive effects of patch area on species richness of the three insect taxa, but not of plants. Isolation had a negative effect only on hoverflies. Matrix type had contrasting effects on the studied taxa. Species richness of plants and butterflies was lowest in patches in landscapes dominated by arable land and highest in forest-dominated landscapes. For hoverflies, the negative effect of small patch area was strongest in forest-dominated landscapes, and there was a similar non-significant trend for bees. Our study shows the importance of considering matrix characteristics when studying responses to habitat fragmentation. Differences in matrix response among organism groups probably impinge on differing mechanisms. A forest matrix is likely to provide additional resources for butterflies but either constitute a barrier to dispersal or deprive resources as compared to an arable matrix for hoverflies. Enhanced plant diversity in grassland patches embedded in forested landscapes can be explained by habitat generalists more easily invading these patches, or by an unpaid extinction debt in these landscapes.},

We characterized pollination in three populations of Quercus macrocarpa occurring in a highly altered landscape in northeastern Illinois to determine whether isolated remnant stands were reproductively isolated. • Methods: We used microsatellites to genotype all adults and 787 acorns from two isolated savanna remnants and a stand in an old-growth forest. One isolated remnant occurred in a highly urbanized/industrialized landscape, and one occurred in an agricultural landscape. Parentage assignment was used to assess pollen-mediated gene flow. • Key results: Pollen donors from outside the study sites accounted for between 46{\%} and 53{\%} of paternities and did not differ significantly among sites, indicating that similar high levels of gene flow occurred at all three sites. Within stands, the mean pollination distance ranged from 42 to 70 meters, and when accounting for outside pollinations, mean pollination distances were well over 100 meters. Genetic diversity of incoming pollen was extremely high in all three stands. The number of effective pollen donors, N(ep), calculated from paternity assignment was higher than that estimated by an indirect correlated paternity approach. • Conclusions: Our findings indicate that extremely isolated stands of oaks are unlikely to be genetically and reproductively isolated, and remnant stands may contribute to maintaining genetic connectivity in highly modified landscapes.},

abstract = {Resilience is the magnitude of disturbance that can be tolerated before a socioecological system (SES) moves to a different region of state space controlled by a different set of processes. Resilience has multiple levels of meaning: as a metaphor related to sustainability, as a property of dynamic models, and as a measurable quantity that can be assessed in field studies of SES. The operational indicators of resilience have, however, received little attention in the literature. To assess a system's resilience, one must specify which system configuration and which disturbances are of interest. This paper compares resilience properties in two contrasting SES, lake districts and rangelands, with respect to the following three general features: (a) The ability of an SES to stay in the domain of attraction is related to slowly changing variables, or slowly changing disturbance regimes, which control the boundaries of the domain of attraction or the frequency of events that could push the system across the boundaries. Examples are soil phosphorus content in lake districts woody vegetation cover in rangelands, and property rights systems that affect land use in both lake districts and rangelands. (b) The ability of an SES to self-organize is related to the extent to which reorganization is endogenous rather than forced by external drivers. Self-organization is enhanced by coevolved ecosystem components and the presence of social networks that facilitate innovative problem solving. (c) The adaptive capacity of an SES is related to the existence of mechanisms for the evolution of novelty or learning. Examples include biodiversity at multiple scales and the existence of institutions that facilitate experimentation, discovery, and innovation. },

Some authors argue that predictions of a tropical forest extinction crisis based on analyses of deforestation rates are overly pessimistic since they do not take account of future agricultural abandonment as a result of rural-urban migration and subsequent secondary regrowth. Even if such regrowth occurs, it is crucial to consider threats to species that are not directly correlated with area of forest cover. Hunting is an insidious but significant driver of tropical forest defaunation, risking cascading changes in forest plant and animal composition. Ineffective legislation and enforcement along with a failure of decision makers to address the threats of hunting is fanning the fire of a tropical forest extinction crisis. If tropical forest ecosystems are to survive, the threat of unsustainable hunting must be adequately addressed now.},

abstract = {Over the past century, the Brazilian Atlantic forest has been reduced to small, isolated fragments of forest. Reproductive isolation theories predict a loss of genetic diversity and increases in inbreeding and spatial genetic structure (SGS) in such populations. We analysed eight microsatellite loci to investigate the pollen and seed dispersal patterns, genetic diversity, inbreeding and SGS of the tropical tree Copaifera langsdorffii in a small (4.8 ha), isolated population. All 112 adult trees and 128 seedlings found in the stand were sampled, mapped and genotyped. Seedlings had signifi-cantly lower levels of genetic diversity (A ¼ 16.5 ± 0.45, mean±95{\%} s.e.; H e ¼ 0.838±0.006) than did adult trees (A ¼ 23.2±0.81; H e ¼ 0.893±0.030). Parentage analysis did not indicate any seed immigration (m seeds ¼ 0) and the pollen immigration rate was very low (m pollen ¼ 0.047). The average distance of realized pollen dispersal within the stand was 94 m, with 81{\%} of the pollen travelling o150 m. A significant negative correlation was found between the frequency and distance of pollen dispersal (r ¼ {\`{A}}0.79, Po0.01), indicating that short-distance pollinations were more frequent. A significant SGS for both adults (B50 m) and seedlings (B20 m) was also found, indicating that most of the seeds were dispersed over short distances. The results suggested that the spatial isolation of populations by habitat fragmentation can restrict seed and pollen gene flow, increase SGS and affect the genetic diversity of future generations.},

abstract = {Global climate change is already having an impact on species ranges. For species with slow demography and limited disper- sal, such as trees, lags between climate change and distribution shifts are likely to increase in the future. Such lags can be of critical importance to management and biodiversity of forests, because they can result in ‘extinction debts', where populations temporarily persist under unsuitable conditions, and ‘colonization credits', where suitable locations are not occupied owing to slow demography and limited dispersal. Here we use a range dynamics model based on metapopulation theory to show that the distributions of 21 dominant trees in eastern North America are out of equilibrium with climate and demonstrate both extinc- tion debt and colonization credit. Moreover, lags are more severe at northern range limits, suggesting that range contraction in response to warming temperatures will outpace expansion. B},

Modern coexistence theory (MCT) and related techniques explore this phenomenon by examining the chance of a species population growing from rarity in the presence of all other species. The mean growth rate when rare, (Formula presented.), is used in MCT as a metric that measures persistence properties (like invasibility or time to extinction) of a population. Here we critique this reliance on (Formula presented.) and show that it fails to capture the effect of temporal random abundance variations on persistence properties. The problem becomes particularly severe when an increase in the amplitude of stochastic temporal environmental variations leads to an increase in (Formula presented.), since at the same time it enhances random abundance fluctuations and the two effects are inherently intertwined. In this case, the chance of invasion and the mean extinction time of a population may even go down as (Formula presented.) increases.},

abstract = {Human-aided movement of species populations in large-scale reforestation programs could be a potent and cost-effective climate change adaptation strategy. Such largescale management interventions, however, tend to entail the risks of unintended consequences, and we propose that three conditions should be met before implementing assisted migration in reforestation programs: (1) evidence of a climate-related adaptational lag, (2) observed biological impacts, and (3) robust model projections to target assisted migration efforts. In a case study of aspen (Populus tremuloides Michaux.) we use reciprocal transplant experiments to study adaptation of tree populations to local environments. Second, we monitor natural aspen populations using the MODIS enhanced vegetation index as a proxy for forest health and productivity. Last, we report results from bioclimate envelope models that predict suitable habitat for locally adapted genotypes under observed and predicted climate change. The combined results support assisted migration prescriptions and indicate that the risk of inaction likely exceeds the risk associated with changing established management practices. However, uncertainty in model projections also implies that we are restricted to a relatively short 20-year planning horizon for prescribing seed movement in reforestation programs. We believe that this study exemplifies a safe and realistic climate change adaptation strategy based on multiple sources of information and some understanding of the uncertainty associated with recommendations for assisted migration. Ad hoc migration prescriptions without a similar level of supporting information should be avoided in reforestation programs. {\textcopyright} 2011 by the Ecological Society of America.},

The community is calling for restoration and sustainable management of white pine on their ancestral territory. As a first step towards this goal, key informant interviews were used to document the cultural importance of white pine to the Kitcisakik community. White pine was perceived as an important component of traditional life, providing several goods and services. White pine is featured in legends, is used as a medicine, provides habitat for flagship wildlife species, and is a prominent part of cultural landscapes. White pine is a cultural keystone species for the Kitcisakik Algonquin community. Local people point to extensive logging as the reason behind white pine decline on the ancestral territory. They suggest that mixed plantations should be used in a culturally adapted restoration strategy.},

abstract = {Understanding how climate affects tree growth is essential for assessing climate change impacts on forests but can be confounded by effects of competition, which strongly influences tree responses to climate. We characterized the joint influences of tree size, competition, and climate on diameter growth using hierarchical Bayesian methods applied to permanent sample plot data from the montane forests of Mount Rainier National Park, Washington State, USA, which are mostly comprised of Abies amabilis Douglas ex Forbes, Tsuga heterophylla (Raf.) Sarg., Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco, and Thuja plicata Donn ex D. Don. Individual growth was sensitive to climate under low but not high competition, likely because tree ability to increase growth under more favorable climates (generally greater energy availability) was constrained by competition, with important variation among species. Thus, climate change will likely increase individual growth most in uncrowded stands with lower competition. However, crowde...},

abstract = {We studied temporal allele frequency shifts over 15 years and estimated the genetically effective size of four natural populations of brown trout (Salmo trutta L.) on the basis of the variation at 14 polymorphic allozyme loci. The allele frequency differences between consecutive cohorts were significant in all four populations. There were no indications of natural selection, and we conclude that random genetic drift is the most likely cause of temporal allele frequency shifts at the loci examined. Effective population sizes were estimated from observed allele frequency shifts among cohorts, taking into consideration the demographic characteristics of each population. The estimated effective sizes of the four populations range from 52 to 480 individuals, and we conclude that the effective size of natural brown trout popula- tions may differ considerably among lakes that are similar in size and other apparent characteristics. In spite of their different effective sizes all four populations have similar levels of genetic variation (average heterozygosity) indicating that excessive loss of genetic variability has been retarded, most likely because of gene flow among neighboring populations.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Studies of tree recruitment are many, but they provide few general insights into the role of recruitment limitation for population dynamics. That role depends on the vital rates (transitions) from seed production to sapling stages and on overall population growth. To determine the state of our understanding of recruitment limitation we examined how well we can estimate parameters corresponding to these vital rates. Our two-part analysis consists of (1) a survey of published literature to determine the spatial and temporal scale of sampling that is basis for parameter estimates, and (2) an analysis of extensive data sets to evaluate sampling intensity found in the literature. We find that published studies focus on fine spatial scales, emphasizing large numbers of small samples within a single stand, and tend not to sample multiple stands or variability across landscapes. Where multiple stands are sampled, sampling is often inconsistent. Sampling of seed rain, seed banks, and seedlings typically span {\textless} 1 yr and rarely last 5 yr. Most studies of seeding establishment and growth consider effects of a single variable and a single life history stage. By examining how parameter estimates are affected by the spatial and temporal extent of sampling we find that few published studies are sufficiently extensive to capture the variability in recruitment stages. Early recruitment stages are especially variable and require samples across multiple years and multiple stands. Ironically, the longest duration data sets are used to estimate mortality rates, which are less variable (in time) than are early life history stages. Because variables that affect recruitment rates interact, studies of these interactions are needed to assess their full impacts. We conclude that greater attention to spatially extensive and longer duration sampling for early life history stages is needed to assess the role of recruitment limitation in forests.},

abstract = {Metabolism provides a basis for using first principles of physics, chemistry, and biology to link the biology of individual organisms to the ecology of populations, communities, And ecosystems. Metabolic rate, the rate at which organisms take up, transform, and expend energy and materials, is the most fundamental biological rate. We have developed a quantitative theory for how metabolic rate varies with body size and temperature. Metabolic theory predicts how metabolic rate, by setting the rates of resource uptake from the environment and resource allocation to survival, growth, and reproduction, controls ecological processes at all levels of organization from individuals to the biosphere. Examples include: (1) life history attributes, including development rate, mortality rate, age at maturity, life span, and population growth rate; (2) population interactions, including carrying capacity, rates of competition and predation, and patterns of species diversity; and (3) ecosystem processes, including rates of biomass production and respiration and patterns of trophic dynamics. Data compiled from the ecological literature strongly support the theoretical predictions. Eventually, metabolic theory may provide a conceptual foundation for much of ecology, just as genetic theory provides a foundation for much of evolutionary biology.},

abstract = {Most tropical rainforests have been defaunated of large-bodied mammals and the cascading effects of such extirpations have been poorly studied, particularly on other animals. We used a natural experiment in the Brazilian Atlantic rainforest to investigate the ecological responses of rodents to the functional extinction of a dominant terrestrial mammal, the white-lipped peccary (Tayassu pecari). We detected a 45{\%} increase in the abundance and a decrease in diversity of rodents in defaunated forests. Two of these species (Akodon montensis and Oligoryzomys nigripes) are important hosts of Hantavirus, a lethal virus for humans. Stable isotope ratios ($\delta${\textless}sup{\textgreater}13{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}C and $\delta${\textless}sup{\textgreater}15{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}N) derived from the hair of rodents and peccaries and their food resources indicate that at least two rodent species shifted to a diet more similar to peccaries in the defaunated forest. Because most tropical rainforests are facing dramatic extirpation of large mammals, we can expect changes in the composition and structure of small mammal communities with potential consequences for human health even in non-fragmented landscapes.},

abstract = {Cloud forest tree species are reported to be shifting and retracting their distributional ranges in response to increasing temperatures. However, there is limited information regarding the impact of increasing temperatures on the recruitment of cloud forest trees, a critical phase in population dynamics. Evaluating the establishment of introduced seedlings along an elevation gradient offers an opportunity to assess the influence of environmental change on the early establishment and potential response of cloud forest tree species to assisted migration into higher elevations as a mitigation strategy. We evaluated the early seedling establishment of 3240 seedlings of 12 cloud forest tree species introduced into nine degraded forests subjected to traditional selective logging along an elevation gradient (1250–2517 m a.s.l.) in southern Mexico. We examined (1) how the probability of successful seedling establishment varies along the elevation gradient and (2) how temperature, canopy cover, herbaceous cover and humidity affect seedling survival and growth. Seedling survival, relative growth rates and environmental factors were recorded over a period of two years. Most species displayed high survival (∼90{\%}), and survivorship was most strongly related to canopy cover and temperature. Survival probability increased with canopy cover in five species. Seedling survival and growth decreased with increasing temperature in five species, while the opposite trend was found in two species. Growth rates increased with herbaceous cover in seven species. Humidity had no effect on seedling performance. Our experiment shows that most of the study species have a high probability of seedling survival under canopy cover, even outside the limits of their reported elevational ranges. The results indicate that five of the studied cloud forest species may already benefit from assisted migration to cooler climatic conditions at higher elevations. This study supports the design of management guidelines for assisting the migration of cloud forest tree species with narrow distributions, as a climate change mitigation strategy.},

abstract = {Global warming will jeopardize the persistence and genetic diversity of many species. Assisted colonization, or the movement of species beyond their current range boundary, is a conservation strategy proposed for species with limited dispersal abilities or adaptive potential. However, species that rely on photoperiodic and thermal cues for development may experience conflicting signals if transported across latitudes. Relocating multiple, distinct populations may remedy this quandary by expanding genetic variation and promoting evolutionary responses in the receiving habitat - a strategy known as assisted gene flow. To better inform these policies, we planted seeds from latitudinally distinct populations of the annual legume, Chamaecrista fasciculata, in a potential future colonization site north of its current range boundary. Plants were exposed to ambient or elevated temperatures via infrared heating. We monitored several life history traits and estimated patterns of natural selection to determine the adaptive value of plastic responses. To assess the feasibility of assisted gene flow between phenologically distinct populations, we counted flowers each day and estimated the degree of temporal isolation between populations. Increased temperatures advanced each successive phenological trait more than the last, resulting in a compressed life cycle for all but the southern-most population. Warming altered patterns of selection on flowering onset and vegetative biomass. Population performance was dependent on latitude of origin, with the northern-most population performing best under ambient conditions and the southern-most performing most poorly, even under elevated temperatures. Among-population differences in flowering phenology limited the potential for genetic exchange among the northern- and southern-most populations. All plastic responses to warming were neutral or adaptive; however, photoperiodic constraints will likely necessitate evolutionary responses for long-term persistence, especially when involving populations from disparate latitudes. With strategic planning, our results suggest that assisted colonization and assisted gene flow may be feasible options for preservation.},

abstract = {Tree mortality in Amazonia has been related to regional variation in soil, topography and climatic disturbances, but the magnitude of the effect of these factors on tree mortality at local and mesoscales remains poorly determined. We investigated tree mortality in 72 1-ha permanent plots spanning 64km2 of tropical moist forest in Reserva Ducke, Manaus, Brazil. Plots were censused three times (2000-2003, 2003-2005, and 2005-2008), resulting in two census intervals. The relationships of soil and topography to tree mortality were dependent on tree size. Small- and medium-sized trees (1≤dbh{\textless}30cm) had similar relationships of mortality with soil and topography, while large trees (dbh≥30cm) showed different (or no) relationships. The effects of soil and topography on tree mortality also varied temporally. In the second census interval after storms, soil and topography explained about one-fourth of the spatial variation in mortality of small- and medium-sized trees ({\textless}30cm dbh), whereas no effects were detected in the first census interval. In particular, soil fertility was the most important predictor of tree mortality in the study area. Topography alone (altitude and slope) was associated with only 12{\%} of the spatial variation in tree mortality and the magnitude of the effect of soil and topography on tree mortality also increased after storms. In general, plots on more fertile soils, on steep slopes and sandy soils in valleys showed greater tree mortality than those on plateau with well-drained clayey soils. Therefore, disturbance history and tree size should be included when scaling up tree mortality from local to regional scales. As much variation remains unexplained, other landscape features, such as watershed morphology and wind exposure, may be necessary to make more precise predictions on patterns of tree mortality in Central Amazonia. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The role of Brazilian pine (Araucaria angustifolia) in the process of forest succession is a topic of increasing controversy. While some authors consider the species to be pioneer, others consider it to be a climax species in relict temperate forests. We designed a field experiment to assess the role of light availability on the regeneration of A. angustifolia. The following three forests, with contrasting patterns of the species regeneration, were selected at a National Forest in southern Brazil: a Pinus plantation, an Araucaria plantation and a native araucarian forest. We analysed the population structure of Brazilian pine, the vegetation architecture, the light regime experienced by seedlings and the height growth of seedlings and sprouts. Brazilian pine colonisation and regeneration were observed in the Pinus and Araucaria plantations, respectively. No seedlings were found in the native forest. The greatest foliage area index and canopy cover were found in the native forest and the smallest in the Pinus plantation. In spite of the architectural differences, the native forest and the Araucaria plantation had similar light conditions and they both had lower levels of irradiances than the Pinus plantation. Seedlings and sprouts of Brazilian pine were found to occupy spots in the Araucaria plantation with canopy cover greater than the average forest conditions. Considering the similarity of understorey light conditions between the Araucaria plantation and the native forest (where no regeneration was taking place), we concluded that light availability was not limiting the regeneration of the species. Tolerance to shading and other aspects of the species indicate that Brazilian pine is not strictly heliophyllous and pioneer and is able to be established in the forest understorey.},

abstract = {The correspondence between species distribution and the environment depends on species' ability to track favorable environmental conditions (via dispersal) and to maintain competitive hierarchy against the constant influx of migrants (mass effect) and demographic stochasticity (ecological drift). Here we report a simulation study of the influence of landscape structure on species distribution. We consider lottery competition for space in a spatially heterogeneous environment, where the landscape is represented as a network of localities connected by dispersal. We quantified the contribution of neutrality and species sorting to their spatial distribution. We found that neutrality increases and the strength of species-sorting decreases with the centrality of a community in the landscape when the average dispersal among communities is low, whereas the opposite was found at elevated dispersal. We also found that the strength of species-sorting increases with environmental heterogeneity. Our results illustrate that spatial structure of the environment and of dispersal must be taken into account for understanding species distribution. We stress the importance of spatial geographic structure on the relative importance of niche vs. neutral processes in controlling community dynamics.},

abstract = {Conservation of pollinator abundance and diversity is an important issue because it contributes to maintaining a diverse community of plant species in agroecosystems. The presence of semi-natural areas favorable to pollination is a key factor for achieving this objective of sustainability. Sowing mixtures of dicotyledonous plants that are rich in pollen and nectar as flower strips along field margins is an efficient solution to attract pollinators and to support their foraging activity on arable land. The enhancement of agroecosystems requires operational methods that make it possible to assess the impact of existing and sown semi-natural areas on pollination. We developed here a new predictive indicator that can be used at the field margin and floral levels, which predicts the pollination value of floral diversity and abundance of field margins on arable land. We based the predictive indicator on decision trees using "if-then" linguistic rules because of the lack of sufficient quantitative knowledge about the relationships between floral traits and pollination. This approach makes it possible to use quantitative and qualitative information. We associated fuzzy subsets to the decision trees and the classes of variables in order to avoid the knife-edge effect of class limits. At the species level, the indicator depends on three criteria: (i) visual attractiveness in terms of flower size, color and UV reflection; (ii) flower accessibility according to the botanical family, the symmetry and the shape of the flower; and (iii) the reward linked to pollen and nectar quantity and quality. An aggregation procedure allows us to obtain a value at the field margin level for each month as a function of the flowering period and pollination activity. Examples of calculations for honeybees, wild bees, bumblebees and hoverflies are shown. The evaluation of the predictive quality yielded significant correlations between pollinator abundance and the indicator value. The level of correlation is satisfying for this type of indicator, which might be further improved with additional data on plant traits. Coupling this indicator with a model that assesses the impact of management on plant diversity and abundance will be a further step to help agronomists who work on the improvement of arable farming management in order to lower its negative impact on pollination. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The South Brazilian grasslands occupy some 13.7 million ha and support very high levels of biodiversity. This paper reviews the current state of ecological knowledge on South Brazilian Campos and of threats and challenges associated with their conservation. The principal factors shaping grassland physiognomy and diversity are discussed, and information is presented on diversity of plant species; best estimates suggest that 3000-4000 phanerophytes occur in the South Brazilian grasslands. It is argued that, despite their high species richness, Campos vegetation is not adequately protected under current conservation policies. In the past three decades, approximately 25{\%} of the grassland area has been lost due to land use changes, and this trend continues. However, representation of Campos grasslands in conservation units is extremely low (less than 0.5{\%}), and the management in most of these is inadequate to preserve the grasslands, as grazing and fire are important factors for their persistence. In conclusion, the following urgent needs are identified: (1) to create more conservation units in different regions, including different grassland types throughout southern Brazil, (2) to develop proper management strategies where grasslands are subject to shrub encroachment and forest expansion, (3) to conduct research on biodiversity and ecological processes in the Campos region and (4) to raise public awareness of the value and vulnerability of this vegetation type. {\textcopyright} 2007 R{\"{u}}bel Foundation, ETH Z{\"{u}}rich.},

Describing, predicting, and managing weed populations requires an understanding of how weeds are distributed spatially and the consequences of this distribution for population processes. Semivariograms and kriged maps of weed populations in several fields have helped describe spatial structure, but few generalizations can be drawn except that populations are aggregated at one or more scales. Limited information is available on the effect of weed arrangement, pattern, or field location on weed population processes. Because weeds are neither regular nor uniform in distribution, mean density alone is of limited value in estimating yield loss or describing population dynamics over a whole field. Sampling strategies that account for spatial distribution can increase sampling efficiency. Further research should focus on understanding processes that cause changes in spatial distributions over time to help predict rates of invasion and potential extent of colonization.},

abstract = {In order to determine the implications of including planted populations in conservation planning, we investigate the structure and genetic diversity, mating system, and effective population size within families in three planted and one natural Araucaria angustifolia populations. The study area is a Brazilian National Forest in southern Brazil, established in the 1950s. Genetic analysis was investigated using nine allozyme loci. Significant and positive fixation index was detected for the adults of all studied populations. Although we observed lower levels of genetic diversity and biparental inbreeding in some populations, their pattern of mating, similar to that expected in panmixia, indicates that all populations can be used in conservation planning. Furthermore, the presence of unique alleles and the significant genetic differentiation among all adult populations (F ST = 0.404) reinforces that all populations are important conservation resources. The average paternity correlation was high in almost all populations, showing that open-pollinated families are composed of mixtures of half- and full-sibs. With regards to conservation strategies, our results suggest that seed collection from at least 133 seed trees is necessary to retain a reference effective population size of 500. Our results confirm that the planted Araucaria forests in southern Brazil can be useful as a genetic resource for conservation, breeding and reforestation strategies for this threatened species. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {Seed dispersal of feral crop plants along roadverges is likely to be influenced by numerous anthropogenic vectors in the agroecosystem. Within the context of introducing genetically modified (GM) cultivars, long-distance dispersal of feral seeds associated with the growth of GM feral populations (via a selective advantage due to transgene expression) could make these populations become invasive. Their expansion could then favour the spread of transgenes and modify the composition of roadverge plant communities. Because quantitative data on anthropogenic seed dispersal along roadverges were few, we estimated effective secondary dispersal for oilseed rape, the seeds of which are not adapted to dispersal by wind or biotic agents. A seed deposition experiment showed that secondary dispersal did not systematically occur along roadverges, was correlated with traffic intensity and was local. Low traffic intensity and anthropogenic disturbances (covering of seeds by mown grasses and burial by farming machinery) prevented dispersal on three of the experimental sites. Along a road with higher traffic, secondary dispersal occurred (dmax=21.5 m), probably induced by wind turbulence behind vehicles. The best-fitting dispersal kernel was a mixture of two components: 20{\%} of seeds dispersing over a few metres on average and 80{\%} remaining in the original place. Expansion rates of feral populations of GM herbicide-tolerant oilseed rape were computed using an invasion model and this kernel. They were low (1-4 m yr-1) when only ballistic and/or secondary dispersal were included but higher (4-20 m yr-1) when theoretically rare events of long-distance dispersal by verge mowers were added. This study suggests that secondary seed dispersal is unlikely to have a significant impact on the spread of GM feral oilseed rape populations in highly disturbed and dynamic habitats such as roadverges. Detecting long-distance dispersal events induced by other vectors (e.g. mowers) would require integrative approaches based on genetic and spatial data. {\textcopyright} 2007 Gesellschaft f{\"{u}}r {\"{O}}kologie.},

In total, an area of 1,200 m(2) was sampled, with 231 recorded species belonging to 60 botanical families. Species diversity and richness increased with planting age up to 35 years. Canopy cover was the variable that best explained the colonization of the understory in some stages. Maintenance activities in the reforestations over the years selected species capable of germinating or sprouting and growing rapidly. However, our results show that A. angustifolia commercial reforestations are home to many native plant species. Thus, the objectives of commercial reforestation can be harmonized with the interests of conservation biology, applying management alternatives with the aim of changing current forestry models.},

We report the impacts of experimental species extinctions on the functioning of two food webs of freshwater and marine systems. We used a linear model to partition the variance among the multiple components of the diversity effect (linear group richness, nonlinear group richness, and identity). The identity of each functional group was the best explaining variable of ecosystem functioning for both systems. We assessed the contribution of each functional group in multifunctional space and found that, although the effect of functional group varied across ecosystem functions, some functional groups shared common effects on functions. This study is the first experimental demonstration that functional identity dominates the effects of extinctions on ecosystem functioning, suggesting that generalizations are possible despite the inherent complexity of interactions.

abstract = {Analyses of ecological data should account for the uncertainty in the process(es) that generated the data. However, accounting for these uncertainties is a difficult task, since ecology is known for its complexity. Measurement and/or process errors are often the only sources of uncertainty modeled when addressing complex ecological problems, yet analyses should also account for uncertainty in sampling design, in model specification, in parameters governing the specified model, and in initial and boundary conditions. Only then can we be confident in the scientific inferences and forecasts made from an analysis. Probability and statistics provide a framework that accounts for multiple sources of uncertainty. Given the complexities of ecological studies, the hierarchical statistical model is an invaluable tool. This approach is not new in ecology, and there are many examples (both Bayesian and non-Bayesian) in the literature illustrating the benefits of this approach. In this article, we provide a baseline for concepts, notation, and methods, from which discussion on hierarchical statistical modeling in ecology can proceed. We have also planted some seeds for discussion and tried to show where the practical difficulties lie. Our thesis is that hierarchical statistical modeling is a powerful way of approaching ecological analysis in the presence of inevitable but quantifiable uncertainties, even if practical issues sometimes require pragmatic compromises. {\textcopyright} 2009 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract = {Species distribution models (SDMs) are increasingly proposed to support conservation decision making. However, evidence of SDMs supporting solutions for on-ground conservation problems is still scarce in the scientific literature. Here, we show that successful examples exist but are still largely hidden in the grey literature, and thus less accessible for analysis and learning. Furthermore, the decision framework within which SDMs are used is rarely made explicit. Using case studies from biological invasions, identification of critical habitats, reserve selection and translocation of endangered species, we propose that SDMs may be tailored to suit a range of decision-making contexts when used within a structured and transparent decision-making process. To construct appropriate SDMs to more effectively guide conservation actions, modellers need to better understand the decision process, and decision makers need to provide feedback to modellers regarding the actual use of SDMs to support conservation decisions. This could be facilitated by individuals or institutions playing the role of 'translators' between modellers and decision makers. We encourage species distribution modellers to get involved in real decision-making processes that will benefit from their technical input; this strategy has the potential to better bridge theory and practice, and contribute to improve both scientific knowledge and conservation outcomes.},

Losses by dissolved organic pathways can alter ratios of nutrients that are recycled and supplied within the plant�soil system, thereby influencing competition and coexistence among plant species. In special cases, our extended model does not differ from classical models, but in more realistic cases our model introduces new dynamical behavior that influences competitive outcomes. At equilibrium, coexistence still depends on nutrient supply and consumption, but nutrient supply includes recycling and is highly sensitive to whether a species promotes more organic losses of the nutrient that limits its own growth than of nutrients that limit its competitors. Because recycling operates with a time delay compared with consumption, recycling-mediated effects on competition can, under certain conditions, lead to sustained population oscillations. Our findings have implications for how we understand nutrient competition, nutrient cycles, and plant evolutionary strategies.},

abstract = {The rapid disruption of tropical forests probably imperils global biodiversity more than any other contemporary phenomenon. With deforestation advancing quickly, protected areas are increasingly becoming final refuges for threatened species and natural ecosystem processes. However, many protected areas in the tropics are themselves vulnerable to human encroachment and other environmental stresses. As pressures mount, it is vital to know whether existing reserves can sustain their biodiversity. A critical constraint in addressing this question has been that data describing a broad array of biodiversity groups have been unavailable for a sufficiently large and representative sample of reserves. Here we present a uniquely comprehensive data set on changes over the past 20 to 30 years in 31 functional groups of species and 21 potential drivers of environmental change, for 60 protected areas stratified across the worlds major tropical regions. Our analysis reveals great variation in reserve health: about half of all reserves have been effective or performed passably, but the rest are experiencing an erosion of biodiversity that is often alarmingly widespread taxonomically and functionally. Habitat disruption, hunting and forest-product exploitation were the strongest predictors of declining reserve health. Crucially, environmental changes immediately outside reserves seemed nearly as important as those inside in determining their ecological fate, with changes inside reserves strongly mirroring those occurring around them. These findings suggest that tropical protected areas are often intimately linked ecologically to their surrounding habitats, and that a failure to stem broad-scale loss and degradation of such habitats could sharply increase the likelihood of serious biodiversity declines. {\textcopyright} 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {Understanding long-term coexistence of numerous competing species is a longstanding challenge in ecology. Progress requires determining which processes and species differences are most important for coexistence when multiple processes operate and species differ in many ways. Modern coexistence theory (MCT), formalised by Chesson, holds out the promise of doing that, but empirical applications remain scarce. We argue that MCT's mathematical complexity and subtlety have obscured the simplicity and power of its underlying ideas and hindered applications. We present a general computational approach that extends our previous solution for the storage effect to all of standard MCT's spatial and temporal coexistence mechanisms, and also process-defined mechanisms amenable to direct study such as resource partitioning, indirect competition, and life history trade-offs. The main components are a method to partition population growth rates into contributions from different mechanisms and their interactions, and numerical calculations in which some mechanisms are removed and others retained. We illustrate how our approach handles features that have not been analysed in the standard framework through several case studies: competing diatom species under fluctuating temperature, plant–soil feedbacks in grasslands, facilitation in a beach grass community, and niche differences with independent effects on recruitment, survival and growth in sagebrush steppe.},

Here, epi-benthic megafauna was sampled at 755 stations in the Lower Estuary and Northern Gulf of St. Lawrence (EGSL) each summer between 2006 and 2009. We combined various types of multivariate analyses to 1) describe the structure and spatial distribution of benthic communities, 2) analyse the relationship between these communities and environmental parameters, and subsequently 3) build a community distribution model to predict the spatial distribution of the communities, creating community distribution maps covering the entire area to be used for marine management and conservation. We identified distinct benthic communities in the study area that closely correlate with the 200. m depth contour and with major environmental variables. A redundancy analysis revealed that communities were associated with depth, oxygen saturation, temperature, bottom current, seabed uniformity, distance to coast and type of sediment. Together these environmental descriptors explained 38{\%} of the variation in megafaunal community composition. The environmental variables were used to build a community distribution model using generalized linear models to predict high and low suitability zones of each community in the EGSL. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

They are used to gain ecological and evolutionary insights and to predict distributions across landscapes, sometimes requiring extrapolation in space and time. SDMs are now widely used across terrestrial freshwater and marine realms. Differences in methods between disciplines reflect both differences in species mobility and in "established use." Model realism and robustness is influenced by selection of relevant predictors and modeling method, consideration of scale, how the interplay between environmental and geographic factors is handled, and the extent of extrapolation. Current linkages between SDM practice and ecological theory are often weak, hindering progress. Remaining challenges include: improvement of methods for modeling presence-only data and for model selection and evaluation; accounting for biotic interactions; and assessing model uncertainty.},

Methods: Commercial D-dimer assays, evaluated according to predetermined cutoff levels for each assay, specific for age (lower in subjects {\textless}70 years) and gender (lower in males), were used in the recent DULCIS study. The present analysis compared the results obtained in the DULCIS with those that might have been had using the following different cutoff criteria: traditional cutoff for VTE exclusion, higher levels in subjects aged ≥60 years, or age multiplied by 10. Results: In young subjects, the DULCIS low cutoff levels resulted in half the recurrent events that would have occurred using the other criteria. In elderly patients, the DULCIS results were similar to those calculated for the two age-adjusted criteria. The adoption of traditional VTE exclusion criteria would have led to positive results in the large majority of elderly subjects, without a significant reduction in the rate of recurrent event. Conclusion: The results confirm the usefulness of the cutoff levels used in DULCIS.},

abstract = {Decades of theory and empirical studies have demonstrated links between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, yet the putative processes that underlie these patterns remain elusive. This is especially true for forest ecosystems, where the functional traits of plant species are challenging to quantify. We analyzed 74,563 forest inventory plots that span 35 ecoregions in the contiguous USA and found that in {\~{}}77{\%} of the ecoregions mixed mycorrhizal plots were more productive than plots where either arbuscular or ectomycorrhizal fungal-associated tree species were dominant. Moreover, the positive effects of mixing mycorrhizal strategies on forest productivity were more pronounced at low than high tree species richness. We conclude that at low richness different mycorrhizal strategies may allow tree species to partition nutrient uptake and thus can increase community productivity, whereas at high richness other dimensions of functional diversity can enhance resource partitioning and community productivity. Our findings highlight the importance of mixed mycorrhizal strategies, in addition to that of taxonomic diversity in general, for maintaining ecosystem functioning in forests.},

abstract = {Abstract.—Harsh conditions (e.g., mortality and stress) reduce population growth rates directly; secondarily, they may reduce the intensity of interactions between organisms. Near-exclusive fo- cus on the secondary effect of these forms of harshness has led ecologists to believe that they reduce the importance of ecological interactions, such as competition, and favor coexistence of even ecologically very similar species. By examining both the costs and the benefits, we show that harshness alone does not lessen the importance of species interactions or limit their role in community structure. Species coexistence requires niche differences, and harshness does not in itself make coexistence more likely. Fluctuations in environmental conditions (e.g., disturbance, seasonal change, and weather variation) also have been regarded as decreasing species interac- tions and favoring coexistence, but we argue that coexistence can only be favored when fluctua- tions create spatial or temporal niche opportunities. We argue that important diversity-promoting roles for harsh and fluctuating conditions depend on deviations from the assumptions of additive effects and linear dependencies most commonly found in ecological models. Such considerations imply strong roles for species interactions in the diversity of a community.},

Despite reports that adults of some species of lowland tropical trees show clumped distributions (Poore 1968; Ashton 1969), I believe that a third generalization is possible about tropical tree species as contrasted with temperate ones: for most species of lowland tropical trees, adults do not produce new adults in their immediate vicinity (where most seeds fall). Because of this, most adults of a given tree species appear to be more regularly distributed than if the probability of a new adult appearing at a point in the forest were proportional to the number of seeds arriving at that point. This generalization is based on my observa- tions in Central and South American mainland forests, on discussions with foresters familiar with these forests, on discussions with J. H. Connell about Australian rain forests, and on data given in the papers cited above.},

abstract = {Regime shifts between alternative stable ecosystem states are becoming commonplace due to the combined effects of local stressors and global climate change. Alternative states are characterised as substantially different in form and function to pre-disturbance states, disrupting the delivery of ecosystem services and functions. On coral reefs, regime shifts are typically characterised by a change in the benthic composition from coral- to macroalgal-dominance. Such fundamental shifts in the benthos are anticipated to impact associated fish communities that are reliant on the reef for food and shelter, yet there is limited understanding of how regime shifts propagate through the fish community over time, relative to initial or recovery conditions. This study addresses this knowledge gap using long-term data of coral reef regime shifts and recovery on Seychelles reefs following the 1998 mass bleaching event. It shows how trophic structure of the reef fish community becomes increasingly dissimilar between alternative reef ecosystem states (regime-shifted vs recovering) with time since disturbance. Regime-shifted reefs developed a concave trophic structure, with increased biomass in base trophic levels as herbivorous species benefitted from increased algal resources. Mid trophic level species, including specialists such as corallivores, declined with loss of coral habitat, while biomass was retained in upper trophic levels by large-bodied, generalist invertivores. Recovering reefs also experienced an initial decline in mid trophic level biomass, but moved towards a bottom-heavy pyramid shape, with a wide range of feeding groups (e.g. planktivores, corallivores, omnivores) represented at mid trophic levels. Given the importance of coral reef fishes in maintaining the ecological function of coral reef ecosystems and their associated fisheries, understanding the effects of regime shifts on these communities is essential to inform decisions that enhance ecological resilience and economic sustainability.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 John Wiley  {\&}  Sons Ltd/CNRS. Correlations between community-weighted mean (CWM) traits and environmental gradients are often assumed to quantify the adaptive value of traits. We tested this assumption by comparing these correlations with models of survival probability using 46 perennial species from long-term permanent plots in pine forests of Arizona. Survival was modelled as a function of trait × environment interactions, plant size, climatic variation and neighbourhood competition. The effect of traits on survival depended on the environmental conditions, but the two statistical approaches were inconsistent. For example, CWM-specific leaf area (SLA) and soil fertility were uncorrelated. However, survival was highest for species with low SLA in infertile soil, a result which agreed with expectations derived from the physiological trade-off underpinning leaf economic theory. CWM trait-environment relationships were unreliable estimates of how traits affected survival, and should only be used in predictive models when there is empirical support for an evolutionary trade-off that affects vital rates.},

abstract = {Premise of study: Have Gondwanan rainforest floral associations survived? Where do they occur today? Have they survived continuously in particular locations? How significant is their living floristic signal? We revisit these classic questions in light of significant recent increases in relevant paleobotanical data.
Methods: We traced the extinction and persistence of lineages and associations through the past across four now separated regions—Australia, New Zealand, Patagonia, and Antarctica—using fossil occurrence data from 63 well-dated Gondwanan rainforest sites and 396 constituent taxa. Fossil sites were allocated to four age groups: Cretaceous, Paleocene-Eocene, Neo-gene plus oligocene, and Pleistocene. We compared the modern and ancient distributions of lineages represented in the fossil record to see if dissimilarity increased with time. We quantified similarity-dissimilarity of composition and taxonomic structure among fossil assemblages, and between fossil and modern assemblages.
Key results: Strong similarities between ancient Patagonia and Australia confirmed shared Gondwanan rainforest history, but more of the lineages persisted in Australia. Samples of ancient Australia grouped with the extant floras of Australia, New Guinea, New Caledonia, Fiji, and Mt. Kinabalu. Decreasing similarity through time among the regional floras of Antarctica, Patagonia, New Zealand, and southern Australia reflects multiple extinction events.
Conclusions: Gondwanan rainforest lineages contribute significantly to modern rainforest community assembly and often co-occur in widely separated assemblages far from their early fossil records. Understanding how and where lineages from ancient Gondwanan assemblages co-occur today has implications for the conservation of global rainforest vegetation, including in the old World tropics.},

abstract = {Managing crop pests (weeds, insects, pathogens, etc.) to limit both crop production loss and environmental impacts is a major challenge of agriculture. Because of the large number of factors and the complexity of interactions, models are invaluable tools to synthesize our knowledge on pests and to quantify the effects of cropping systems on pest dynamics. These models must be able to rank candidate cropping systems as a function of pest frequency and severity, and to account for variability in effects to estimate the risk of success or failure of a particular system. Two contrasting approaches are possible. Mechanistic models describe variability with process-based, usually deterministic sub-models quantifying interactions between cropping system components and environmental conditions. Empirical models directly relate observations to input variables, using few parameters, and usually quantify variability with probabilistic (stochastic) functions. The present paper critically evaluates these a priori contradictory approaches, i.e. deterministic vs. stochastic and mechanistic vs. empirical representations of cropping system effects in pest dynamics models, relative to model objectives and scales, pest species, scientific disciplines and knowledge level. We do not attempt to be exhaustive but analyse a small number of contrasting models to identify their advantages, disadvantages and complementarities. The paper concludes that models using a mechanistic representation of the cropping system ?? environment interactions are best for quantifying effects and accounting for their variability, combined with a subsequent transformation with in silico experiments into empirical models of the major cropping system components. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

abstract = {Interactions between multiple disturbances are of special concern in ecology due to their potential for non-linear behavior and long-lasting legacies on landscape structure and function. If multiple disturbances overcome the ecological resilience of a system, alternate stable states are possible. Increases in the frequency and severity of disturbance events as a result of climate change heighten this concern. This study directly addresses the question of ecosystem resilience in the face of multiple disturbances. We investigated a gradient of disturbance interaction severities between two events in a subalpine forest, a 1997 windstorm (variable severity) and a 2002 wildfire (high-severity). A third disturbance, salvage logging of blowdown (19992001) prior to the fire, served as a de facto experimental treatment. Ninety- nine study plots were established across the disturbance gradient, including fire-only areas for a baseline fire response. Modeling indicated that the combination of two severe disturbances created novel conditions which exceeded the resilience mechanisms of the system. Modeled mean fire residence time and temperature (First Order Fire Effects Model, FOFEM), as well as mean distance to potential seed sources, increased as a result of the interaction. Regeneration 8 years post-fire was essentially absent in medium- to high-severity blowdown þ fire plots, whereas low-severity blowdown þ fire and fire-only areas showed strong regeneration. Blowdown þ salvage þ fire had significantly higher regeneration than areas of comparable blowdown, suggesting that fuel loading drove the interaction. CART analysis supported this hypothesis. Multiple disturbances have the potential to create surprising situations and reduce the resilience of an ecosystem. Differential recovery as a result of a novel disturbance created by compounding events will likely have long lasting legacies across the landscape.},

abstract = {Classical approaches to food webs focus on patterns and processes occurring at the community level rather than at the broader ecosystem scale, and often ignore spatial aspects of the dynamics. However, recent research suggests that spatial processes influence both food web and ecosystem dynamics, and has led to the idea of 'metaecosystems'. However, these processes have been tackled separately by 'food web metacommunity' ecology, which focuses on the movement of traits, and 'landscape ecosystem' ecology, which focuses on the movement of materials among ecosystems. Here, we argue that this conceptual gap must be bridged to fully understand ecosystem dynamics because many natural cases demonstrate the existence of interactions between the movements of traits and materials. This unification of concepts can be achieved under the metaecosystem framework, and we present two models that highlight how this framework yields novel insights. We then discuss patches, limiting factors and spatial explicitness as key issues to advance metaecosystem theory. We point out future avenues for research on metaecosystem theory and their potential for application to biological conservation.},

abstract = {A model is presented of the spread of a weed from a point source, with dispersal being both unaided and aided by a combine harvester. Four “type” weeds were modeled, chosen to represent species of differing population and dispersal ecologies and based broadly on Avena spp. (wild oats), Raphanus raphanistrum (wild radish), Bromus spp. (bromegrass), and Fumaria spp. (fumitory). Wind-adapted species were excluded. The greatest rate of spread was predicted to be for R. raphanistrum and the least for Fumaria, regardless of whether dispersal by combine harvester was included. Rate of spread was more sensitive to dispersal parameters than to demographic parameters and increased up to 16-fold as soon as any seeds were dispersed by the harvester. Given that uptake by the harvester is a function of phenology of seed production and dispersal, better data on such processes is required for weeds. Because rate of spread is more dependent on dispersal than on demographic factors, greater attention needs to be given to describing dispersal frequency distributions and especially to analysis of their shapes.},

Even moderate habitat destruction is predicted to cause time-delayed but deterministic extinction of the dominant competitor in remnant patches. Further species are predicted to become extinct, in order from the best to the poorest competitors, as habitat destruction increases. Moreover, the more fragmented a habitat already is, the greater is the number of extinctions caused by added destruction.

abstract = {Human impacts on Earth's ecosystems have greatly intensified in the last decades. This is reflected in unexpected disturbance events, as well as new and increasing socio-economic demands, all of which are affecting the resilience of forest ecosystems worldwide and the provision of important ecosystem services. This Anthropocene era is forcing us to reconsider past and current forest management and silvicultural practices, and search for new ones that are more flexible and better at dealing with the increasing uncertainty brought about by these accelerating and cumulative global changes. Here, we briefly review the focus and limitations of past and current forest management and silvicultural practices mainly as developed in Europe and North America. We then discuss some recent promising concepts, such as managing forests as complex adaptive systems, and approaches based on resilience, functional diversity, assisted migration and multi-species plantations, to propose a novel approach to integrate the functionality of species-traits into a functional complex network approach as a flexible and multi-scale way to manage forests for the Anthropocene. This approach takes into consideration the high level of uncertainty associated with future environmental and societal changes. It relies on the quantification and dynamic monitoring of functional diversity and complex network indices to manage forests as a functional complex network. Using this novel approach, the most efficient forest management and silvicultural practices can be determined, as well as where, at what scale, and at what intensity landscape-scale resistance, resilience and adaptive capacity of foreststoglobalchangescanbeimproved.},

In cases with and without climatic change, the effects of including random or structured fragmentation and successively lower dispersal probabilities (increased chance of long-distance dispersal) are examined in simulation experiments. The exclusion of very low dispersal probability (p {\textless} 0.001) has an important effect on species richness. Barriers and random fragmentation also lower diversity.

Using a meta-analysis, we estimated that the distributions of species have recently shifted to higher elevations at a median rate of 11.0 meters per decade, and to higher latitudes at a median rate of 16.9 kilometers per decade. These rates are approximately two and three times faster than previously reported. The distances moved by species are greatest in studies showing the highest levels of warming, with average latitudinal shifts being generally sufficient to track temperature changes. However, individual species vary greatly in their rates of change, suggesting that the range shift of each species depends on multiple internal species traits and external drivers of change. Rapid average shifts derive from a wide diversity of responses by individual species.},

abstract = {Although classical ecological theory (e.g., on ideal free consumers) recognizes the potential effect of population density on the spatial distribution of animals, empirical species distribution models assume that species–habitat relationships remain unchanged across a range of population sizes. Conversely, even though ecological models and experiments have demonstrated the importance of spatial heterogeneity for the rate of population change, we still have no practical method for making the connection between the makeup of real environments, the expected distribution and fitness of their occupants, and the long-term implications of fitness for population growth. Here, we synthesize several conceptual advances into a mathematical framework using a measure of fitness to link habitat availability/selection to (density-dependent) population growth in mobile animal species. A key feature of this approach is that it distinguishes between apparent habitat suitability and the true, underlying contribution of a habitat to fitness, allowing the statistical coefficients of both to be estimated from multiple observation instances of the species in different environments and stages of numerical growth. Hence, it leverages data from both historical population time series and snapshots of species distribution to predict population performance under environmental change. We propose this framework as a foundation for building more realistic connections between a population's use of space and its subsequent dynamics (and hence a contribution to the ongoing efforts to estimate a species' critical habitat and fundamental niche). We therefore detail its associated definitions and simplifying assumptions, because they point to the framework's future extensions. We show how the model can be fit to data on species distributions and population dynamics, using standard statistical methods, and we illustrate its application with an individual-based simulation. When contrasted with nonspatial population models, our approach is better at fitting and predicting population growth rates and carrying capacities. Our approach can be generalized to include a diverse range of biological considerations. We discuss these possible extensions and applications to real data.},

abstract = {1 Climate change has already caused distribution shifts in many species, and climate predictions strongly suggest that these will accelerate in the future. Obtaining reliable predictions of species range shifts under climate change is thus currently one of the most crucial challenges for both ecologists and stakeholders. 2 Here we simulate the distributions of 16 North American tree species at a continental scale for the 21st century according to two IPCC storylines, using a process-based species distribution model that for the first time allows identification of the possible causes of distribution change. 3 Our projections show local extinctions in the south of species ranges (21{\%} of the present distribution, on average), and colonizations of new habitats in the north, though these are limited by dispersal ability for most species. Areas undergoing local extinctions are slightly larger under climate scenario A2 (+3.2 C, +22{\%} on average) than B2 (+1.0 C, +19{\%} on average). This small difference is caused by nonlinear responses of processes (leaves and flowers phenological processes in particular) to temperature. We also show that local extinction may proceed at a slower rate than forecasted so far. 4 Although predicted distribution shifts are very species-specific, we show that the loss of habitats southward will be mostly due to increased drought mortality and decreased reproductive success, while northward colonizations will be primarily promoted by increased probability of fruit ripening and flower frost survival. 5 Synthesis. Our results show that different species will not face the same risks due to climate change, because their responses to climate differ as well as their dispersal rate. Focusing on processes, our study therefore tempers the alarming conclusions of widely used niche-based models about biodiversity loss, mainly because our predictions take into account the local adaptation and trait plasticity to climate of the species.},

Human-mediated seed dispersal (i.e. anthropochory) greatly increases the dispersal of crop species across agroecosystems. In the case of oilseed rape (OSR), spillage of seeds from grain trailers during harvest has never been quantified.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Our experimental approach involved establishing 85 seed trap-sites on the road verges of an agricultural area around the grain silo of Selommes (Loir-et-Cher, France). We recorded OSR spillage during harvest and applied a linear model to the data.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The amount of seed spilled was related positively to the area of the OSR fields served by the road, whereas the amount of seed spilled decreased with other variables, such as distance from the trap-site to the verge of the road and to the nearest field. The distance to the grain silo, through local and regional effects, affected seed loss. Local effects from fields adjacent to the road resulted in a cumulative spillage on one-lane roads. On two-lane roads, spillage was nearly constant whatever the distance to the silo due to a mixture of these local effects and of grain trailers that joined the road from more distant fields. From the data, we predicted the number of seeds lost from grain trailers on one road verge in the study area. We predicted a total spillage of 2.05 × 10(6) seeds (± 4.76 × 10(5)) along the road length, which represented a mean of 404 ± 94 seeds per m(2).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Containment of OSR seeds will always be challenging. However, seed spillage could be reduced if grain trailers were covered and filled with less seed. Reducing distances travelled between fields and silos could also limit seed loss.},

abstract = {Farmland biodiversity provides ecological services that support food production, but the spatial scale(s) at which its management should be implemented is an acute question today. Effective management of weeds is a particularly hot issue as these plants can cause yield loss but support farmland biodiversity. In a general context of pesticide reduction, a clear understanding of how agricultural managements at different spatial scales interact with one another in shaping weed communities is required to develop sustainable weed management strategies. Here, we analyzed the contribution of potential drivers of weed species richness and weed abundance in 125 winter-wheat fields under a gradient of crop management intensity. We hypothesized that (i) local management practices in fields and (ii) the structure and composition of the landscape surrounding these fields would both explain the variations in weed richness and weed abundance observed within the study area. Linear mixed-effects models that included sequentially three sets of explanatory variables (farming system, local management practices, landscape structure and management) were applied and the relative performance of models was compared by AIC. Our analysis showed that weed species richness responded to factors acting at multiple spatial scales, with a predominant effect of landscape scale management, namely the proportion of organic farming within a 1 km radius. In contrast, weed abundance was difficult to predict and responded solely to few local management practices. As weed richness and abundance did not respond at the same spatial scales, we conclude that it may be possible to combine local and longer-term landscape management levers to deliver reduced weed infestation levels and enhanced arable biodiversity.},

abstract = {There is considerable debate about the role of competition in shaping species distributions over broad spatial extents. This debate has practical implications because predicting changes in species' geographic ranges in response to ongoing environmental change would be simpler if competition could be ignored. While this debate has been the subject of many reviews, recent literature has not addressed the rates of relevant processes. This omission is surprising in that ecologists hypothesized decades ago that regional competitive exclusion is a slow process. The goal of this review is to reassess the debate under the hypothesis that competitive exclusion over broad spatial extents is a slow process. Available evidence, including simulations presented for the first time here, suggests that competitive exclusion over broad spatial extents occurs slowly over temporal extents of many decades to millennia. Ecologists arguing against an important role for competition frequently study modern patterns and/or range dynamics over periods of decades, while much of the evidence for competition shaping geographic ranges at broad spatial extents comes from paleoecological studies over time scales of centuries or longer. If competition is slow, as evidence suggests, the geographic distributions of some, perhaps many species, would continue to change over time scales of decades to millennia, even if environmental conditions did not continue to change. If the distributions of competing species are at equilibrium it is possible to predict species distributions based on observed species-environment relationships. However, disequilibrium is widespread as a result of competition and many other processes. Studies whose goal is accurate predictions over intermediate time scales (decades to centuries) should focus on factors associated with range expansion (colonization) and loss (local extinction), as opposed to current patterns. In general, understanding of modern range dynamics would be enhanced by considering the rates of relevant processes. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

Here, we study cold adaptation of tree populations in a wide-ranging coniferous species in western North America to inform limits to seed transfer. Using tree-ring signatures of cold damage from common garden trials designed to study genetic population differentiation, we find opposing geographic clines for spring frost and fall frost damage. Provenances from northern regions are sensitive to spring frosts, while the more productive provenances from central and southern regions are more susceptible to fall frosts. Transferring the southern, warm-adapted genotypes northward causes a significant loss of growth and a permanent rank change after a spring frost event. We conclude that cold adaptation should remain an important consideration when implementing seed transfers designed to mitigate harmful effects of climate change.},

abstract = {Knowledge of the ecological requirements determining tree species distributions is a precondition for sustainable forest management. At present, the abiotic requirements and the relative importance of the different abiotic factors are still unclear for many temperate tree species. We therefore investigated the relative importance of climatic and edaphic factors for the abundance of 12 temperate tree species along environmental gradients. Our investigations are based on data from 1,075 forest stands across Switzerland including the cold-induced tree line of all studied species and the drought-induced range boundaries of several species. Four climatic and four edaphic predictors represented the important growth factors temperature, water supply, nutrient availability, and soil aeration. The climatic predictors were derived from the meteorological network of MeteoSwiss, and the edaphic predictors were available from soil profiles. Species cover abundances were recorded in field surveys. The explanatory power of the predictors was assessed by variation partitioning analyses with generalized linear models. For six of the 12 species, edaphic predictors were more important than climatic predictors in shaping species distribution. Over all species, abundances depended mainly on nutrient availability, followed by temperature, water supply, and soil aeration. The often co-occurring species responded similar to these growth factors. Drought turned out to be a determinant of the lower range boundary for some species. We conclude that over all 12 studied tree species, soil properties were more important than climate variables in shaping tree species distribution. The inclusion of appropriate soil variables in species distribution models allowed to better explain species' ecological niches. Moreover, our study revealed that the ecological requirements of tree species assessed in local field studies and in experiments are valid at larger scales across Switzerland.},

abstract = {* In order to understand how changes in individual performance (growth, survival or reproduction) influence population dynamics and evolution, ecologists are increasingly using parameterized mathematical models. * For continuously structured populations, where some continuous measure of individual state influences growth, survival or reproduction, integral projection models (IPMs) are commonly used. * We provide a detailed description of the steps involved in constructing an IPM, explaining how to: (i) translate your study system into an IPM; (ii) implement your IPM; and (iii) diagnose potential problems with your IPM. We emphasize how the study organism's life cycle, and the timing of censuses, together determine the structure of the IPM kernel and important aspects of the statistical analysis used to parameterize an IPM using data on marked individuals. * An IPM based on population studies of Soay sheep is used to illustrate the complete process of constructing, implementing and evaluating an IPM fitted to sample data. * We then look at very general approaches to parameterizing an IPM, using a wide range of statistical techniques (e.g. maximum likelihood methods, generalized additive models, nonparametric kernel density estimators). Methods for selecting models for parameterizing IPMs are briefly discussed. * We conclude with key recommendations and a brief overview of applications that extend the basic model.

The species is nowadays critically endangered by deforestation and global climate change. The goal of this study was to analyse the dynamics of radial growth in this species and its association with climatic variables, according to the sex, at its western range boundary in Argentina. Standard dendrochronological techniques were applied on stem disks from female and male trees. Xylem anatomical anomalies made the tree-ring dating process difficult. Female and male trees showed growth patterns that changed over time, not being significant in the 1950–1990 period and highly significant from the 1990s onwards (p{\textless}0.1) when female trees had a higher growth rate. Female and male trees showed a different association with climatic variables. No significant effect of temperature and precipitation was identified on female trees. For male trees, rainfall had a positive effect in August, before the growing season, and a negative effect at the end of the growing season (March). Temperature had a negative effect on male trees, before and during the growing season (February and January, respectively). No effect of SOI was detected on both sexes. Results emphasised the usefulness of A. angustifolia for dendrochronological studies and the value of dioecious species for the study of sex-related growth–climate association.},

abstract = {The rapid disruption of tropical forests probably imperils global biodiversity more than any other contemporary phenomenon. With deforestation advancing quickly, protected areas are increasingly becoming final refuges for threatened species and natural ecosystem processes. However, many protected areas in the tropics are themselves vulnerable to human encroachment and other environmental stresses. As pressures mount, it is vital to know whether existing reserves can sustain their biodiversity. A critical constraint in addressing this question has been that data describing a broad array of biodiversity groups have been unavailable for a sufficiently large and representative sample of reserves. Here we present a uniquely comprehensive data set on changes over the past 20 to 30 years in 31 functional groups of species and 21 potential drivers of environmental change, for 60 protected areas stratified across the worlds major tropical regions. Our analysis reveals great variation in reserve health: about half of all reserves have been effective or performed passably, but the rest are experiencing an erosion of biodiversity that is often alarmingly widespread taxonomically and functionally. Habitat disruption, hunting and forest-product exploitation were the strongest predictors of declining reserve health. Crucially, environmental changes immediately outside reserves seemed nearly as important as those inside in determining their ecological fate, with changes inside reserves strongly mirroring those occurring around them. These findings suggest that tropical protected areas are often intimately linked ecologically to their surrounding habitats, and that a failure to stem broad-scale loss and degradation of such habitats could sharply increase the likelihood of serious biodiversity declines. {\textcopyright} 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

It was noticed that both forests showed different behavior in terms of recruitment, mortality, and volume growth, and the possible reason for such a difference is the past history of forest land use in each area. The S˜ ao Jo˜ ao do Triunfo area showed higher growth rate than General Carneiro and Coronel Domingos Soares area, with periodic anual increment (PAI) of 2.829 m3 /ha.year−1 versus 1.476 m3 /ha.year−1 .

Tree mortality was higher in de S˜ ao Jo˜ ao do Triunfo whereas recruitment was higher in General Carneiro and Coronel Domingos Soares.

abstract = {State-space estimation methods are increasingly used in ecology to estimate productivity and abundance of natural populations while accounting for variability in both population dynamics and measurement processes. However, functional forms for population dynamics and density dependence often will not match the true biological process, and this may degrade the performance of state-space methods. We therefore developed a Bayesian semiparametric state-space model, which uses a Gaussian process (GP) to approximate the population growth function. This offers two benefits for population modeling. First, it allows data to update a specified "prior" on the population growth function, while reverting to this prior when data are uninformative. Second, it allows variability in population dynamics to be decomposed into random errors around the population growth function ("process error") and errors due to the mismatch between the specified prior and estimated growth function ("model error"). We used simulation modeling to illustrate the utility of GP methods in state-space population dynamics models. Results confirmed that the GP model performs similarly to a conventional state-space model when either (1) the prior matches the true process or (2) data are relatively uninformative. However, GP methods improve estimates of the population growth function when the function is misspecified. Results also demonstrated that the estimated magnitude of "model error" can be used to distinguish cases of model misspecification. We conclude with a discussion of the prospects for GP methods in other state-space models, including age and length-structured, meta-analytic, and individualmovement models. {\textcopyright} 2014 by the Ecological Society of America.},

Most of the current methods to infer the existence of interactions between two species require a good knowledge of their behaviour or a direct observation of interactions. In this paper, we overcome these limitations by developing a method, inspired from the niche model of food web structure, using the statistical relationship between predator and prey body size to infer the matrix of potential interactions among a pool of species. * The novelty of our approach is to infer, for any species of a given species pool, the three species-specific parameters of the niche model. The method applies to both local and metaweb scales. It allows one to evaluate the feeding interactions of a new species entering the community. * We find that this method gives robust predictions of the structure of food webs and that its efficiency is increased when the strength of the body–size relationship between predators and preys increases. * We finally illustrate the potential of the method to infer the metaweb structure of pelagic fishes of the Mediterranean sea under different global change scenarios.},

abstract = {Understanding coexistence of highly shade-tolerant tree species is a longstanding challenge for forest ecologists. A conceptual model for the coexistence of sugar maple (Acer saccharum) and American beech (Fagus grandibfolia) has been proposed, based on a low-light survival/high-light growth trade-off, which interacts with soil fertility and small-scale spatiotemporal variation in the environment. In this study, we first tested whether the spatial distribution of seedlings and saplings can be predicted by the spatiotemporal variability of light availability and soil fertility, and second, the manner in which the process of environmental filtering changes with regeneration size. We evaluate the support for this hypothesis relative to the one for a neutral model, i.e., for seed rain density predicted from the distribution of adult trees. To do so, we performed intensive sampling over 86 quadrats (5 x 5 m) in a 0.24-ha plot in a mature maple-beech community in Quebec, Canada. Maple and beech abundance, soil characteristics, light availability, and growth history (used as a proxy for spatiotemporal variation in light availability) were finely measured to model variation in sapling composition across different size classes. Results indicate that the variables selected to model species distribution do effectively change with size, but not as predicted by the conceptual model. Our results show that variability in the environment is not sufficient to differentiate these species' distributions in space. Although species differ in their spatial distribution in the small size classes, they tend to correlate at the larger size class in which recruitment occurs. Overall, the results are not supportive of a model of coexistence based on small-scale variations in the environment. We propose that, at the scale of a local stand, the lack of fit of the model could result from the high similarity of species in the range of environmental conditions encountered, and we suggest that coexistence would be stable only at larger spatial scales at which variability in the environment is greater.},

abstract = {Characterizing the diversity of demographic strategies among species can inform research in topics such as trait syndromes, community stability, coexistence, and ecological succession. However, this diversity can depend on the spatial scale considered: at the landscape scale, species often form metapopulations, that is sets of local, sometimes short-lived, populations, inhabiting discrete habitat patches. Metapopulation dynamics are most frequently analyzed in individual species or pairs of interacting species because of the large amount of data required for multiple species, and because species vary in their perceptions of what constitutes a favorable or unfavorable habitat. Here we evaluate, using a case study, whether a metapopulation model can be used to generate accurate estimates of demographic parameters and to describe the diversity of dynamics, responses to environment, and prospects of long-term persistence in a guild of species inhabiting a common fragmented landscape. We applied this approach to a guild of 22 mollusk species that inhabit freshwater habitats on two islands of Guadeloupe, to compare metapopulation dynamics among species. We analyzed a 15-year time series of occupancy records for 278 sites using a multistate occupancy model that estimated colonization and extinction rates as a function of site-specific and year-specific environmental covariates, then used model results to simulate future island metapopulation dynamics. Despite the diverse array of metapopulation trajectories—a mix of species with either stable, increasing, declining, or fluctuating metapopulations—and the inherent challenges associated with such data (e.g., imperfect detection, spatial and temporal heterogeneity), our model accurately captured among-patch variation in suitability for many mollusk taxa. The dynamics of rare species or species with habitat preferences not fully captured by the retained set of covariates were less well described. For several species, we detected a negative correlation between extinction and colonization. This variation in habitat suitability created species-specific extinction-resistant pockets in the landscape. Our comparative analysis also revealed that species had distinct strategies for metapopulation dynamics, such as “fast-turnover” species with both a high proportion of occupied sites and a high rate of site extinction in the landscape.},

abstract = {Pollen dispersal is a critical process that shapes genetic diversity in natural populations of plants. Estimating the pollen dispersal curve can provide insight into the evolutionary dynamics of populations and is essential background for making predictions about changes induced by perturbations. Specifically, we would like to know whether the dispersal curve is exponential, thin-tailed (decreasing faster than exponential), or fat-tailed (decreasing slower than the exponential). In the latter case, rare events of long-distance dispersal will be much more likely. Here we generalize the previously developed TWOGENER method, assuming that the pollen dispersal curve belongs to particular one- or two-parameter families of dispersal curves and estimating simultaneously the parameters of the dispersal curve and the effective density of reproducing individuals in the population. We tested this method on simulated data, using an exponential power distribution, under thin-tailed, exponential and fat-tailed conditions. We find that even if our estimates show some bias and large mean squared error (MSE), we are able to estimate correctly the general trend of the curve - thin-tailed or fat-tailed - and the effective density. Moreover, the mean distance of dispersal can be correctly estimated with low bias and MSE, even if another family of dispersal curve is used for the estimation. Finally, we consider three case studies based on forest tree species. We find that dispersal is fat-tailed in all cases, and that the effective density estimated by our model is below the measured density in two of the cases. This latter result may reflect the difficulty of estimating two parameters, or it may be a biological consequence of variance in reproductive success of males in the population. Both the simulated and empirical findings demonstrate the strong potential of TWOGENER for evaluating the shape of the dispersal curve and the effective density of the population (d(e)).},

One critical, albeit often ignored, limitation of these area-based estimates is their disregard of the ecological context that shapes species distributions. In this study, we estimate species loss using a spatially explicit mechanistic simulation model to evaluate three important aspects of ecological context: coexistence mechanisms (e.g. species sorting, competition–colonization tradeoffs and neutral dynamics), spatial distribution of environmental conditions, and spatial pattern of habitat loss. We found that 1) area-based estimates of extinctions are sensitive to coexistence mechanisms as well as to the pattern of environmental heterogeneity; 2) there is a strong interaction between coexistence mechanisms and the pattern of habitat loss; 3) SARs always yield higher estimates of species loss than do EARs; and 4) SARs and EARs consistently underestimate the realized species loss. Our results highlight the need to integrate ecological mechanisms in area-estimates of species loss. Species},

abstract = {Understanding of the determinants of species' geographic range limits remains poorly integrated. In part, this is because of the diversity of perspectives on the issue, and because empirical studies have lagged substantially behind developments in theory. Here, I provide a broad overview, drawing together many of the disparate threads, considering, in turn, how influences on the terms of a simple single-population equation can determine range limits. There is theoretical and empirical evidence for systematic changes towards range limits under some circumstances in each of the demographic parameters. However, under other circumstances, no such changes may take place in particular parameters, or they may occur in a different direction, with limitation still occurring. This suggests that (i) little about range limitation can categorically be inferred from many empirical studies, which document change in only one demographic parameter, (ii) there is a need for studies that document variation in all of the parameters, and (iii) in agreement with theoretical evidence that range limits can be formed in the presence or absence of hard boundaries, environmental gradients or biotic interactions, there may be few general patterns as to the determinants of these limits, with most claimed generalities at least having many exceptions.},

abstract = {Drought events are increasing globally, and reports of consequent forest mortality are widespread. However, due to a lack of a quantitative global synthesis, it is still not clear whether drought-induced mortality rates differ among global biomes and whether functional traits influence the risk of drought-induced mortality. To address these uncertainties, we performed a global meta-analysis of 58 studies of drought-induced forest mortality. Mortality rates were modelled as a function of drought, temperature, biomes, phylogenetic and functional groups and functional traits. We identified a consistent global-scale response, where mortality increased with drought severity [log mortality (trees trees−1 year−1) increased 0.46 (95{\%} CI = 0.2–0.7) with one SPEI unit drought intensity]. We found no significant differences in the magnitude of the response depending on forest biomes or between angiosperms and gymnosperms or evergreen and deciduous tree species. Functional traits explained some of the variation in drought responses between species (i.e. increased from 30 to 37{\%} when wood density and specific leaf area were included). Tree species with denser wood and lower specific leaf area showed lower mortality responses. Our results illustrate the value of functional traits for understanding patterns of drought-induced tree mortality and suggest that mortality could become increasingly widespread in the future.},

abstract = {Aim: To evaluate current and future dynamics of 25 tree species spanning United States and Canada. Location: United States and Canada. Methods: We combine, for the first time, the species compositions from relative importance derived from the USA's Forest Inventory Analysis (FIA) with gridded estimates based on Canada's National Forest Inventory (NFI-kNN))-based photo plot data to evaluate future habitats and colonization potentials for 25 tree species. Using 21 climatic variables under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5, we model climatic habitat suitability (HQ) within a consensus-based multimodel ensemble regression approach. A migration model is used to assess colonization likelihoods (CL) for {\~{}}100 years and combined with HQ to evaluate the various combinations of HQ + CL outcomes for the 25 species. Results: At a continental scale, many species in the conterminous United States lose suitable climatic habitat (especially under RCP 8.5) while Canada and USA's Alaska gain climate habitat. For most species, even under optimistic migration rates, only a small portion of overall future suitable habitat is projected to be naturally colonized in {\~{}}100 years, although considerable variation exists among species. Main conclusions: For the species examined here, habitat losses were primarily experienced along southern range limits, while habitat gains were associated with northern range limits (especially under RCP 8.5). However, for many species, southern range limits are projected to remain relatively intact, albeit with reduced habitat quality. Our models predict that only a small portion of the climatic habitat generated by climate change will be colonized naturally by the end of the current century—even with optimistic tree migration rates. However, considerable variation among species points to the need for significant management efforts, including assisted migration, for economic or ecological reasons. Our work highlights the need to employ range-wide data, evaluate colonization potentials and enhance cross-border collaborations.},

abstract = {With the rise of new powerful statistical techniques and GIS tools, the development of predictive habitat distribution models has rapidly increased in ecology. Such models are static and probabilistic in nature, since they statistically relate the geographical distribution of species or communities to their present environment. A wide array of models has been developed to cover aspects as diverse as biogeography, conservation biology, climate change research, and habitat or species management. In this paper, we present a review of predictive habitat distribution modeling. The variety of statistical techniques used is growing. Ordinary multiple regression and its generalized form (GLM) are very popular and are often used for modeling species distributions. Other methods include neural networks, ordination and classification methods, Bayesian models, locally weighted approaches (e.g. GAM), environmental envelopes or even combinations of these models. The selection of an appropriate method should not depend solely on statistical considerations. Some models are better suited to reflect theoretical findings on the shape and nature of the species' response (or realized niche). Conceptual considerations include e.g. the trade-off between optimizing accuracy versus optimizing generality. In the field of static distribution modeling, the latter is mostly related to selecting appropriate predictor variables and to designing an appropriate procedure for model selection. New methods, including threshold-independent measures (e.g. receiver operating characteristic (ROC)-plots) and resampling techniques (e.g. bootstrap, cross-validation) have been introduced in ecology for testing the accuracy of predictive models. The choice of an evaluation measure should be driven primarily by the goals of the study. This may possibly lead to the attribution of different weights to the various types of prediction errors (e.g. omission, commission or confusion). Testing the model in a wider range of situations (in space and time) will permit one to define the range of applications for which the model predictions are suitable. In turn, the qualification of the model depends primarily on the goals of the study that define the qualification criteria and on the usability of the model, rather than on statistics alone. {\textcopyright} 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {The study of species co-occurrences has been central in community ecology since the foundation of the discipline. Co-occurrence data are, nevertheless, a neglected source of information to model species distributions and biogeographers are still debating about the impact of biotic interactions on species distributions across geographical scales. We argue that a theory of species co-occurrence in ecological networks is needed to better inform interpretation of co-occurrence data, to formulate hypotheses for different community assembly mechanisms, and to extend the analysis of species distributions currently focused on the relationship between occurrences and abiotic factors. The main objective of this paper is to provide the first building blocks of a general theory for species co-occurrences. We formalize the problem with definitions of the different probabilities that are studied in the context of co-occurrence analyses. We analyze three species interactions modules and conduct multi-species simulations in order to document five principles influencing the associations between species within an ecological network: (i) direct interactions impact pairwise co-occurrence, (ii) indirect interactions impact pairwise co-occurrence, (iii) pairwise co-occurrence rarely are symmetric, (iv) the strength of an association decreases with the length of the shortest path between two species, and (v) the strength of an association decreases with the number of interactions a species is experiencing. Our analyses reveal the difficulty of the interpretation of species interactions from co-occurrence data. We discuss whether the inference of the structure of interaction networks is feasible from co-occurrence data. We also argue that species distributions models could benefit from incorporating conditional probabilities of interactions within the models as an attempt to take into account the contribution of biotic interactions to shaping individual distributions of species.},

abstract = {Introduction: D-dimer assay, generally evaluated according to cutoff points calibrated for VTE exclusion, is used to estimate the individual risk of recurrence after a first idiopathic event of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Methods: Commercial D-dimer assays, evaluated according to predetermined cutoff levels for each assay, specific for age (lower in subjects {\textless}70 years) and gender (lower in males), were used in the recent DULCIS study. The present analysis compared the results obtained in the DULCIS with those that might have been had using the following different cutoff criteria: traditional cutoff for VTE exclusion, higher levels in subjects aged ≥60 years, or age multiplied by 10. Results: In young subjects, the DULCIS low cutoff levels resulted in half the recurrent events that would have occurred using the other criteria. In elderly patients, the DULCIS results were similar to those calculated for the two age-adjusted criteria. The adoption of traditional VTE exclusion criteria would have led to positive results in the large majority of elderly subjects, without a significant reduction in the rate of recurrent event. Conclusion: The results confirm the usefulness of the cutoff levels used in DULCIS.},

abstract = {In this study, genetic diversity, inbreeding, spatial genetic structure (SGS), and pollen dispersal are analyzed using ten microsatellite loci from two populations of the dioecious, wind-pollinated, coniferous tree Araucaria angustifolia in Southern Brazil. The study populations include an undisturbed 7 ha A. angustifolia cluster, where all adult trees were mapped and sampled, and an adjacent, long-abandoned, open agricultural area with an aggregated A. angustifolia population. Seeds were collected from 13 seed trees inside the forest cluster and from eight seed trees in the open forest. Our results showed that the adults present high levels of heterozygosity (H o = 0.91) and an absence of inbreeding. However, significant SGS was detected up to 90 m in the forest cluster suggesting that near-neighbor trees are related. The estimate of effective population size was lower than the total number of trees in the cluster (N e/N = 0.19), which can be explained by the presence of SGS in the stand. Substantial external pollen flow was detected in the forest cluster (26 {\%}) and open forest (20 {\%}), indicating that the reproductive population size is greater than the sampled populations, explaining the high genetic diversity in this population. Our results indicate that this site has potential for in and ex situ conservation due to high levels of genetic diversity and gene immigration resulting from pollen flow. Conservation strategies for A. angustifolia should focus not only on forest fragments but should also include the preservation of isolated trees throughout the landscape.},

Response to climate warming over the last century, however, has been mixed, with some treelines showing evidence of recruitment at higher altitudes and/or latitudes (advance) whereas others reveal no marked change in the upper limit of tree establishment. To explore this variation, we analysed a global dataset of 166 sites for which treeline dynamics had been recorded since 1900 AD. Advance was recorded at 52{\%} of sites with only 1{\%} reporting treeline recession. Treelines that experienced strong winter warming were more likely to have advanced, and treelines with a diffuse form were more likely to have advanced than those with an abrupt or krummholz form. Diffuse treelines may be more responsive to warming because they are more strongly growth limited, whereas other treeline forms may be subject to additional constraints.},

Since little effort has been made towards conservation of these resources, the assessment and the integration of information and knowledge so far generated are valuable tools in order to promote their conservation. In the present work the Brazilian conifer Araucaria angustifolia was used as a case study, integrating information, published between 1980 and 2007, about genetics, biotechnology, palaeobotany, and archeology. These studies were interpreted towards the conservation needs and strategies of the species germplasm. The main conclusions for the conservation of A. angustifolia genetic resources are: (1) despite the reduction of genetic diversity by unsustainable forest exploitation, the genetic system of A. angustifolia seems to be efficient to protect this species against rapid losses of its genetic diversity; (2) conservation measures starting now may be efficient, since the genetic structures of existing populations is more largely influenced by the past evolutionary process than by human disturbance occurred in the last century; (3) there are opportunities to save the genetic resources of the species, if simple measures are taken to safeguard the continued existence of the few remaining araucaria forests. Emerged as a general conclusion that the use of sound scientific arguments supported by different areas of the science could be a very powerful instrument in persuading decision-makers, also by governments, taking into account forest genetic resources as a primary issue for the future. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.},

abstract = {Mortality and recruitment rates are fundamental measures of population dynamics. Ecologists and others have defined and estimated these vital rates in various ways. We review these alternatives focusing on tree population census data in fixed area plots, though many aspects have wider application when similar data characteristics and assumptions apply: our goal is to guide choices and facilitate comparisons. We divide our estimates into “instantaneous” and “annual” rates, corresponding to continuous or discrete time dynamics, respectively. In each case, vital rate estimates can be further divided into those based on population density (“per-capita” rates) and those based on census area (“per-area” rates). We also examine how all such rate estimates relate to each other and can thus be interconverted and compared. In a heterogeneous population (e.g. trees in a forest stand) comprising subpopulations (e.g. species, locations, exposure classes), estimates of vital rates that assume homogeneity (equal likelihood of mortality and equal likelihood of recruitment for all individuals) are biased towards lower vital rates in stable mixed populations (due to survivorship bias) and towards lower absolute values of population change rate (due to changing-frequency bias). We describe and illustrate an individual-based Bayesian procedure for estimating vital rates that reduces biases by accounting for demographic heterogeneity and sampling errors among and within subpopulations.},

Reproductive isolation theories predict a loss of genetic diversity and increases in inbreeding and spatial genetic structure (SGS) in such populations. We analysed eight microsatellite loci to investigate the pollen and seed dispersal patterns, genetic diversity, inbreeding and SGS of the tropical tree Copaifera langsdorffii in a small (4.8 ha), isolated population. All 112 adult trees and 128 seedlings found in the stand were sampled, mapped and genotyped. Seedlings had significantly lower levels of genetic diversity (A=16.5±0.45, mean95{\%} s.e.; H e=0.838±0.006) than did adult trees (A=23.2±0.81; H e=0.893±0.030). Parentage analysis did not indicate any seed immigration (m seeds = 0) and the pollen immigration rate was very low (m pollen = 0.047). The average distance of realized pollen dispersal within the stand was 94 m, with 81{\%} of the pollen travelling 150 m. A significant negative correlation was found between the frequency and distance of pollen dispersal (r = -0.79, P=0.01), indicating that short-distance pollinations were more frequent. A significant SGS for both adults (50 m) and seedlings (20 m) was also found, indicating that most of the seeds were dispersed over short distances. The results suggested that the spatial isolation of populations by habitat fragmentation can restrict seed and pollen gene flow, increase SGS and affect the genetic diversity of future generations. {\textcopyright} 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Much of the recent work on species coexistence is based on studying per-capita growth rates of species when rare (invasion growth rates) in deterministic models where populations have continuous densities and extinction only occurs as densities approach zero over an infinite time horizon. In nature, extinctions occur in finite time and rarity corresponds to small, discrete populations whose dynamics are not well approximated by deterministic models. To understand whether the biological significance of these discrepancies, we parameterized a stochastic counterpart of a classical deterministic model of competition using data from annual plants competing on serpentine soils. While the minimum of the invasion growth rates explained up to 60{\%} of the variation in the predicted coexistence times, species pairs with similar invasion growth rates had coexistence times that differed by several orders of magnitude. By integrating the deterministic invasion growth rates and coexistence equilibrium population sizes, a simplified stochastic model explained over 99{\%} of the variation in the coexistence times. This simplified model corresponds to uncoupled single species models whose parameters are determined from the two species model. This simplified model shows that coexistence times are approximately one-half of the harmonic mean of these single species' persistence times. Furthermore, coexistence times increase and saturate with invasion growth rates, but increase exponentially with equilibrium population sizes. When the minimum of the invasion growth rate is sufficiently greater than one, coexistence times of 1,000 years occur even when the inferior species has {\textless}50 individuals at the deterministic coexistence equilibrium. When the fitness inferior has the lower equilibrium population size (which occurs for 6 out of 8 of the deterministically coexisting pairs), niche overlap and fitness differences negatively impact coexistence times, which is consistent with the deterministic theory. However, when the fitness inferior has the higher equilibrium population size (2 species pairs), coexistence times can exhibit a humped shaped relationship with fitness differences--increasing and then decreasing with fitness differences. Collectively our results support the use of deterministic theory to infer the controls over coexistence in finite systems, while also highlighting when ecologists must look beyond invasion growth rates and consider species' equilibrium population sizes.},

Phylogenetic diversity has recently been suggested as a predictor of ecosystem functioning because it could approximate the functional complementarity among species. Here we describe an experiment that takes advantage of the rapid evolutionary response of bacteria to disentangle the role of phylogenetic and species diversity. We impose a strong selection regime on marine bacterial lineages and assemble the ancestral and evolved lines in microcosms of varying lineage and phylogenetic diversity. We find that the relationship between phylogenetic diversity and productivity is strong for the ancestral lineages but brakes down for the evolved lineages. Our results not only emphasize the potential of using phylogeny to evaluate ecosystem functioning, but also they warn against using phylogenetics as a proxy for functional diversity without good information on species evolutionary history.},

The analysis of spatial autocorrelation demonstrated the presence of internal structure in the first distance classes (up to 70 m), suggesting the presence of family structure. The outcrossing rate was high (0.956), as expected for a dioecious species. However, it was different from unity, indicating outcrossings between related individuals and corroborating the presence of internal genetic structure.

abstract = {Temporal variability in the environment drives variation in individuals' vital rates, with consequences for population dynamics and life history evolution. Integral projection models (IPMs) are data-driven models widely used to study population dynamics and life history evolution of structured populations in temporally variable environments. However, many data sets have insufficient temporal replication for the environmental drivers of vital rates to be identified with confidence, limiting their use for evaluating population level responses to environmental change. Parameter selection, where the kernel is constructed at each time step by randomly selecting the time-varying parameters from their joint probability distribution, is one approach to including stochasticity in IPMs. We consider a factor analytic (FA) approach for modelling the covariance matrix of time-varying parameters, whereby latent variable(s) describe the covariance among vital rate parameters. This decreases the number of parameters estimated and, where the covariance is positive, the latent variable can be interpreted as a measure of environmental quality. We demonstrate this using simulation studies and two case studies. The simulation studies suggest the FA approach provides similarly accurate estimates of stochastic population growth rate to estimating an unstructured covariance matrix. We demonstrate how the latent parameter can be perturbed to show how selection on reproductive delays in the monocarp Carduus nutans changes under different environmental conditions. We develop a demographic model of the fire dependent herb Eryngium cuneifolium to show how a causal indicator (i.e. a driver of the changes in the environmental quality) can be incorporated with the addition of a single parameter. Using perturbation analyses we determine optimal management strategies for this species. This approach estimates fewer parameters than previous approaches and allows novel eco-evolutionary insights. Predictions on population dynamics and life history evolution under different environmental conditions can be made without necessarily identifying causal factors. Environmental drivers can be incorporated with relatively few parameters, allowing for predictions on how populations will be affected by changes to these drivers.},

abstract = {The challenges that face humanity today differ from the past because as the scale of human influence has increased, our biggest challenges have become global in nature, and formerly local problems that could be addressed by shifting populations or switching resources, now aggregate (i.e., "scale up") limiting potential management options. Adaptive management is an approach to natural resource management that emphasizes learning through management based on the philosophy that knowledge is incomplete and much of what we think we know is actually wrong. Adaptive management has explicit structure, including careful elucidation of goals, identification of alternative management objectives and hypotheses of causation, and procedures for the collection of data followed by evaluation and reiteration. It is evident that adaptive management has matured, but it has also reached a crossroads. Practitioners and scientists have developed adaptive management and structured decision making techniques, and mathematicians have developed methods to reduce the uncertainties encountered in resource management, yet there continues to be misapplication of the method and misunderstanding of its purpose. Ironically, the confusion over the term "adaptive management" may stem from the flexibility inherent in the approach, which has resulted in multiple interpretations of "adaptive management" that fall along a continuum of complexity and a priori design. Adaptive management is not a panacea for the navigation of 'wicked problems' as it does not produce easy answers, and is only appropriate in a subset of natural resource management problems where both uncertainty and controllability are high. Nonetheless, the conceptual underpinnings of adaptive management are simple; there will always be inherent uncertainty and unpredictability in the dynamics and behavior of complex social-ecological systems, but management decisions must still be made, and whenever possible, we should incorporate learning into management. {\textcopyright} 2010 .},

abstract = {Aim Greenhouse-induced warming and resulting shifts in climatic zones may exceed the migration capabilities of some species. We used fourteen combinations of General Circulation Models (GCMs) and Global Vegetation Models (GVMs) to investigate possible migration rates required under CO2-doubled climatic forcing. Location Global. Methods Migration distances were calculated between grid cells of future biome type x and nearest same-biome-type cells in the current climate. In `base-case' calculations, we assumed that 2 × CO2 climate forcing would occur in 100 years, we used ten biome types and we measured migration distances as straight-line distances ignoring water barriers and human development. In sensitivity analyses, we investigated different time periods of 2 × CO2 climate forcing, more narrowly defined biomes and barriers because of water bodies and human development. Results In the base-case calculations, average migration rates varied significantly according to the GVM used (BIOME3 vs. MAPSS), the age of the GCM (older- vs. newer-generation GCMs), and whether or not GCMs included sulphate cooling or CO2 fertilization effects. However, high migration rates (≥ 1000 m year−1) were relatively common in all models, consisting on average of 17{\%} grid cells for BIOME3 and 21{\%} for MAPSS. Migration rates were much higher in boreal and temperate biomes than in tropical biomes. Doubling of the time period of 2 × CO2 forcing reduced these areas of high migration rates to c. 12{\%} of grid cells for both BIOME3 and MAPSS. However, to obtain migration rates in the Boreal biome that were similar in magnitude to those observed for spruce when it followed the retreating North American Glacier, a radical increase in the period of warming was required, from 100 to {\textgreater}1000 years. A reduction in biome area by an order of magnitude increased migration rates by one to three orders of magnitude, depending on the GVM. Large water bodies and human development had regionally important effects in increasing migration rates. Main conclusions In conclusion, evidence from coupled GCMs and GVMs suggests that global warming may require migration rates much faster than those observed during post-glacial times and hence has the potential to reduce biodiversity by selecting for highly mobile and opportunistic species. Several poorly understood factors that are expected to influence the magnitude of any such reduction are discussed, including intrinsic migrational capabilities, barriers to migration, the role of outlier populations in increasing migration rates, the role of climate in setting range limits and variation in species range sizes.},

abstract = {Most populations of Scots pine in Spain are locally adapted to drought, with only a few populations at the southernmost part of the distribution range showing maladaptations to the current climate. Increasing tree heights are predicted for most of the studied populations by the year 2070, under the RCP 8.5 scenario. These results are probably linked to the capacity of this species to acclimatize to new climates. The impact of climate change on tree growth depends on many processes, including the capacity of individuals to respond to changes in the environment. Pines are often locally adapted to their environments, leading to differences among populations. Generally, populations at the margins of the species' ranges show lower performances in fitness-related traits than core populations. Therefore, under expected changes in climate, populations at the southern part of the species' ranges could be at a higher risk of maladaptation. Here, we hypothesize that southern Scots pine populations are locally adapted to current climate, and that expected changes in climate may lead to a decrease in tree performance. We used Scots pine tree height growth data from 15-year-old individuals, measured in six common gardens in Spain, where plants from 16 Spanish provenances had been planted. We analyzed tree height growth, accounting for the climate of the planting sites, and the climate of the original population to assess local adaptation, using linear mixed-effect models. We found that: (1) drought drove differences among populations in tree height growth; (2) most populations were locally adapted to drought; (3) tree height was predicted to increase for most of the studied populations by the year 2070 (a concentration of RCP 8.5). Most populations of Scots pine in Spain were locally adapted to drought. This result suggests that marginal populations, despite inhabiting limiting environments, can be adapted to the local current conditions. In addition, the local adaptation and acclimation capacity of populations can help margin populations to keep pace with climate change. Our results highlight the importance of analyzing, case-by-case, populations' capacities to cope with climate change.},

abstract = {Understanding how variation in growth, survival and reproduction affect population dynamics is a fundamental question in ecology. Although the effects of among-year variation (environmental stochasticity) are well understood, the effects of among-site variation (spatial heterogeneity) are less clearly defined. I evaluated the effects of spatial and temporal variation on the population dynamics of Pulsatilla patens, pasqueflower, a perennial prairie forb. I conducted a 10-year demographic monitoring study, and quantified vital rate variation among sites and years using generalized linear models. I incorporated vital rate functions using this variation into integral projection models for stochastic and spatially heterogeneous environments. I also explored the effects of temporal and spatial autocorrelation, by exploring model predictions over the range of possible values for temporal autocorrelation and local seed dispersal. Vital rates varied more among years than among sites. However, environmental stochasticity and spatial heterogeneity had similar magnitude effects on population dynamics. These effects were also qualitatively different: environmental stochasticity reduced population growth rates relative to the average, whereas spatial heterogeneity increased population growth rates. Spatial autocorrelation and negative temporal autocorrelation led to higher population growth rates, although environmental stochasticity still reduced growth rates for all autocorrelation values, and spatial heterogeneity increased growth rates for all autocorrelation values. Some form of autocorrelation would be necessary for model projections to match observed population trends. Synthesis. Spatial heterogeneity is as important as environmental stochasticity for population dynamics, but it is much less often incorporated into population projection models. This study points to a number of interesting avenues for future research into the roles of spatial heterogeneity and spatiotemporal variation for long-term population dynamics.

To establish a common framework for population dynamics in patchy habitats, we describe an individual-based model (IBM) involving a diffusion approximation of correlated random walk of individual movements. As an example, we apply the model to the Glanville fritillary butterfly (Melitaea cinxia) inhabiting a highly fragmented landscape. We derive stochastic patch occupancy model (SPOM) approximations for the IBMs assuming pure demographic stochasticity, uncorrelated environmental stochasticity, or completely correlated environmental stochasticity in local dynamics. Using realistic parameter values for the Glanville fritillary, we show that the SPOMs mimic the behavior of the IBMs well. The SPOMs derived from IBMs have parameters that relate directly to the life history and behavior of individuals, which is an advantage for model interpretation and parameter estimation. The modeling approach that we describe here provides a unified framework for patchy populations with much movements among habitat patches and classic metapopulations with infrequent movements.},

abstract = {Many plant species are predicted to migrate poleward in response to climate change. Species distribution models (SDMs) have been widely used to quantify future suitable habitats, but they often neglect soil properties, despite the importance of soil for plant fitness. As soil properties often change along latitudinal gradients, higher-latitude soils might be more or less suitable than average conditions within the current ranges of species, thereby accelerating or slowing potential poleward migration. In this study, we built three SDMs – one with only climate predictors, one with only soil predictors, and one with both – for each of 1870 plant species in Eastern North America, in order to investigate the relative importance of soil properties in determining plant distributions and poleward shifts under climate change. While climate variables were the most important predictors, soil properties also had a substantial influence on continental-scale plant distributions. Under future climate scenarios, models including soil predicted much smaller northward shifts in distributions than climate-only models (c. 40{\%} reduction). Our findings strongly suggest that high-latitude soils are likely to impede ongoing plant migration, and they highlight the necessity of incorporating soil properties into models and predictions for plant distributions and migration under environmental change.},

A small population of W. nobilis was discovered in 1994 in a remote canyon system in the Wollemi National Park (near Sydney, Australia). This population contains fewer than 100 individuals and is critically endangered. Previous genetic studies of the Wollemi pine have investigated its evolutionary relationship with other pines in the family Araucariaceae, and have suggested that the Wollemi pine genome contains little or no variation. However, these studies were performed prior to the widespread use of genome sequencing, and their conclusions were based on a limited fraction of the Wollemi pine genome. In this study, we address this problem by determining the entire sequence of the W. nobilis chloroplast genome. A detailed analysis of the structure of the genome is presented, and the evolution of the genome is inferred by comparison with the chloroplast sequences of other members of the Araucariaceae and the related family Podocarpaceae. Pairwise alignments of whole genome sequences, and the presence of unique pseudogenes, gene duplications and insertions in W. nobilis and Araucariaceae, indicate that the W. nobilis chloroplast genome is most similar to that of its sister taxon Agathis. However, the W. nobilis genome contains an unusually high number of repetitive sequences, and these could be used in future studies to investigate and conserve any remnant genetic diversity in the Wollemi pine.},

abstract = {Overhunting in tropical forests reduces populations of vertebrate seed dis- persers. If reduced seed dispersal has a negative impact on tree population viability, overhunting could lead to altered forest structure and dynamics, including decreased biodiversity. However, empirical data show- ing decreased animal-dispersed tree abundance in overhunted forests contradict demographic models which predict minimal sensitivity of tree population growth rate to early life stages. One resolution to this discre- pancy is that seed dispersal determines spatial aggregation, which could have demographic consequences for all life stages. We tested the impact of dispersal loss on population viability of a tropical tree species, Miliusa hors- fieldii, currently dispersed by an intact community of large mammals in a Thai forest. We evaluated the effect of spatial aggregation for all tree life stages, from seeds to adult trees, and constructed simulation models to com- pare population viability with and without animal-mediated seed dispersal. In simulated populations, disperser loss increased spatial aggregation by fourfold, leading to increased negative density dependence across the life cycle and a 10-fold increase in the probability of extinction. Given that the majority of tree species in tropical forests are animal-dispersed, overhunting will potentially result in forests that are fundamentally different from those existing now. 1.},

abstract = {Dispersal, the behaviour ensuring gene flow, tends to covary with a number of morphological, ecological and behavioural traits. While species-specific dispersal behaviours are the product of each species' unique evolutionary history, there may be distinct interspecific patterns of covaria-tion between dispersal and other traits ('dispersal syndromes') due to their shared evolutionary history or shared environments. Using dispersal, phylogeny and trait data for 15 terrestrial and semi-terrestrial animal Orders ({\textgreater} 700 species), we tested for the existence and consistency of dis-persal syndromes across species. At this taxonomic scale, dispersal increased linearly with body size in omnivores, but decreased above a critical length in herbivores and carnivores. Species life history and ecology significantly influenced patterns of covariation, with higher phylogenetic sig-nal of dispersal in aerial dispersers compared with ground dwellers and stronger evidence for dis-persal syndromes in aerial dispersers and ectotherms, compared with ground dwellers and endotherms. Our results highlight the complex role of dispersal in the evolution of species life-his-tory strategies: good dispersal ability was consistently associated with high fecundity and survival, and in aerial dispersers it was associated with early maturation. We discuss the consequences of these findings for species evolution and range shifts in response to future climate change.},

abstract = {The most dramatic property of succession is its repeatable convergence on the same climax community from any of many different starting points. This property is shared by a class of statistical processes known as 'regular Markov chains'. The models of this chapter are basically regular Markov chains. The author examines forest succession as a tree-by-tree replacement process. For each tree in the forest the author estimates the probability that it will be replaced by another of its kind or by another species. From a matrix of these probabilities, one can calculate how many trees of each species should be found at any stage of succession. The author analyzes a generalized successional matrix, examining the relations among: the degree and pattern of exploitation or of natural disturbance, the pattern of reseeding, the diversity of species in the late stages, and the dynamic stability (the speed with which the forest recovers from temporary indignities imposed by man or by nature). The author also analyzes a model of linear, unbranched succession, that allows simple expressions for the stationary distribution, its degree of disturbance, its diversity, and its dynamic stability, all independently defined in biologically realistic ways.},

abstract = {Managing crop pests (weeds, insects, pathogens, etc.) to limit both crop production loss and environmental impacts is a major challenge of agriculture. Because of the large number of factors and the complexity of interactions, models are invaluable tools to synthesize our knowledge on pests and to quantify the effects of cropping systems on pest dynamics. These models must be able to rank candidate cropping systems as a function of pest frequency and severity, and to account for variability in effects to estimate the risk of success or failure of a particular system. Two contrasting approaches are possible. Mechanistic models describe variability with process-based, usually deterministic sub-models quantifying interactions between cropping system components and environmental conditions. Empirical models directly relate observations to input variables, using few parameters, and usually quantify variability with probabilistic (stochastic) functions. The present paper critically evaluates these a priori contradictory approaches, i.e. deterministic vs. stochastic and mechanistic vs. empirical representations of cropping system effects in pest dynamics models, relative to model objectives and scales, pest species, scientific disciplines and knowledge level. We do not attempt to be exhaustive but analyse a small number of contrasting models to identify their advantages, disadvantages and complementarities. The paper concludes that models using a mechanistic representation of the cropping system ?? environment interactions are best for quantifying effects and accounting for their variability, combined with a subsequent transformation with in silico experiments into empirical models of the major cropping system components. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

However, recent papers on butterflies and frogs now show that population-level and species-level extinctions are occurring. The relative lack of previous information about range retractions and extinctions appears to stem, at least partly, from a failure to survey the distributions of species at sufficiently fine resolution to detect declines, and from a failure to attribute such declines to climate change. The new evidence suggests that climate-driven extinctions and range retractions are already widespread. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Using projections of species' distributions for future climate scenarios, we assess extinction risks for sample regions that cover some 20{\%} of the Earth's terrestrial surface. Exploring three approaches in which the estimated probability of extinction shows a power-law relationship with geographical range size, we predict, on the basis of mid-range climate-warming scenarios for 2050, that 15-37{\%} of species in our sample of regions and taxa will be 'committed to extinction'. When the average of the three methods and two dispersal scenarios is taken, minimal climate-warming scenarios produce lower projections of species committed to extinction ( approximately 18{\%}) than mid-range ( approximately 24{\%}) and maximum-change ( approximately 35{\%}) scenarios. These estimates show the importance of rapid implementation of technologies to decrease greenhouse gas emissions and strategies for carbon sequestration.},

abstract = {Herbarium accession data offer a useful historical botanical perspective and have been used to track the spread of plant invasions through time and space. Nevertheless, few studies have utilised this resource for genetic analysis to reconstruct a more complete picture of historical invasion dynamics, including the occurrence of separate introduction events. In this study, we combined nuclear and chloroplast microsatellite analyses of contemporary and historical collections of Senecio madagascariensis, a globally invasive weed first introduced to Australia c. 1918 from its native South Africa. Analysis of nuclear microsatellites, together with temporal spread data and simulations of herbarium voucher sampling, revealed distinct introductions to south-eastern Australia and mid-eastern Australia. Genetic diversity of the south-eastern invasive population was lower than in the native range, but higher than in the mid-eastern invasion. In the invasive range, despite its low resolution, our chloroplast microsatellite data revealed the occurrence of new haplotypes over time, probably as the result of subsequent introduction(s) to Australia from the native range during the latter half of the 20thcentury. Our work demonstrates how molecular studies of contemporary and historical field collections can be combined to reconstruct a more complete picture of the invasion history of introduced taxa. Further, our study indicates that a survey of contemporary samples only (as undertaken for the majority of invasive species studies) would be insufficient to identify potential source populations and occurrence of multiple introductions.},

abstract = {There is a growing interest in using trait-based approaches to characterize the functional structure of animal communities. Quantitative methods have been derived mostly for plant ecology, but it is now common to characterize the functional composition of various systems such as soils, coral reefs, pelagic food webs or terrestrial vertebrate communities. With the ever-increasing availability of distribution and trait data, a quantitative method to represent the different roles of animals in a community promise to find generalities that will facilitate cross-system comparisons. There is, however, currently no theory relating the functional composition of food webs to their dynamics and properties. The intuitive interpretation that more functional diversity leads to higher resource exploitation and better ecosystem functioning was brought from plant ecology and does not apply readily to food webs. Here we appraise whether there are interpretable metrics to describe the functional composition of food webs that could foster a better understanding of their structure and functioning. We first distinguish the various roles that traits have on food web topology, resource extraction (bottom-up effects), trophic regulation (top-down effects), and the ability to keep energy and materials within the community. We then discuss positive effects of functional trait diversity on food webs, such as niche construction and bottom-up effects. We follow with a discussion on the negative effects of functional diversity, such as enhanced competition (both exploitation and apparent) and top-down control. Our review reveals that most of our current understanding of the impact of functional trait diversity on food web properties and functioning comes from an over-simplistic representation of network structure with well-defined levels. We, therefore, conclude with propositions for new research avenues for both theoreticians and empiricists.},

The 50th anniversary of MacArthur and Wilson's (December 1963) article, 'An equilibrium theory of insular zoogeography', was a recent milestone for this theme. Since 1963, island systems have provided new insights into the formation of ecological communities. Here, building on such developments, we highlight prospects for research on islands to improve our understanding of the ecology and evolution of communities in general. Throughout, we emphasise how attributes of islands combine to provide unusual research opportunities, the implications of which stretch far beyond islands. Molecular tools and increasing data acquisition now permit re-assessment of some fundamental issues that interested MacArthur and Wilson. These include the formation of ecological networks, species abundance distributions, and the contribution of evolution to community assembly. We also extend our prospects to other fields of ecology and evolution - understanding ecosystem functioning, speciation and diversification - frequently employing assets of oceanic islands in inferring the geographic area within which evolution has occurred, and potential barriers to gene flow. Although island-based theory is continually being enriched, incorporating non-equilibrium dynamics is identified as a major challenge for the future.},

abstract = {Within the time frame of the longevity of tree species, climate change will change faster than the ability of natural tree migration. Migration lags may result in reduced productivity and reduced diversity in forests under current management and climate change. We evaluated the efficacy of planting climate-suitable tree species (CSP), those tree species with current or historic distributions immediately south of a focal landscape, to maintain or increase aboveground biomass, productivity, and species and functional diversity. We modeled forest change with the LANDIS-II forest simulation model for 100 years (2000-2100) at a 2-ha cell resolution and five-year time steps within two landscapes in the Great Lakes region (northeastern Minnesota and northern lower Michigan, USA). We compared current climate to low-and high-emission futures. We simulated a low-emission climate future with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 2007 B1 emission scenario and the Parallel Climate Model Global Circulation Model (GCM). We simulated a high-emission climate future with the IPCC A1FI emission scenario and the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) GCM. We compared current forest management practices (business-asusual) to CSP management. In the CSP scenario, we simulated a target planting of 5.28{\%} and 4.97{\%} of forested area per five-year time step in the Minnesota and Michigan landscapes, respectively. We found that simulated CSP species successfully established in both landscapes under all climate scenarios. The presence of CSP species generally increased simulated aboveground biomass. Species diversity increased due to CSP; however, the effect on functional diversity was variable. Because the planted species were functionally similar to many native species, CSP did not result in a consistent increase nor decrease in functional diversity. These results provide an assessment of the potential efficacy and limitations of CSP management. These results have management implications for sites where diversity and productivity are expected to decline. Future efforts to restore a specific species or forest type may not be possible, but CSP may sustain a more general ecosystem service (e.g., aboveground biomass).},

abstract = {G. Evelyn Hutchinson more than a half century ago proposed that one could characterize the ecological niche of a species as an abstract mapping of population dynamics onto an environmental space, the axes of which are abiotic and biotic factors that influence birth and death rates. If a habitat has conditions within a species' niche, a population should persist without immigration from external sources, whereas if conditions are outside the niche, it faces extinction. Analyses of species' niches are essential to understanding controls on species' geographical range limits and how these limits might shift in our rapidly changing world. Recent developments in ecology and evolutionary biology suggest it is time to revisit and refine Hutchinson's niche concept. After reviewing techniques for quantifying niches, I examine subtleties that arise because of impacts species have on their own environments, the density-dependent modulation of how individuals experience environments, and the interplay of dispersal and temporal heterogeneity in determining population persistence. Moreover, the evolutionary record over all time scales reveals a spectrum of rates of change in species' niches, from rapid niche evolution to profound niche conservatism. Substantial challenges revolving around the evolutionary dimension of the Hutchinsonian niche include quantifying the magnitude of evolved intraspecific and clade-level variation in niches and understanding the factors that govern where along the spectrum of potential evolutionary rates any given lineage lies. A growing body of theory provides elements of a conceptual framework for understanding niche conservatism and evolution, paving the way for an evolutionary theory of the niche.},

abstract = {Developing adaptive forest management strategies is essential to maintain the provisioning of forest goods and services (FGS) under future climate change. We assessed how climate change and forest management affect forest development and FGS for a diverse casestudy landscape in Central Europe. Using a process-based forest model (LandClim) we simulated forest dynamics and FGS under a range of climate change and management scenarios in the Black Forest, Germany, which is shaped by various management practices. We focused on the interdependencies between timber production and forest diversity, the most valued FGS in this region. We found that the conversion to more drought-adapted forest types is required to prevent climate change-induced forest dieback and that this conversion must be the target of any adaptive management, especially in areas where monocultures of drought-sensitive Norway spruce (Picea abies) were promoted in the past. Forest conversion takes up to 120 years, however, with past and future adaptive management being the key drivers of timber and forest diversity provision. The conversion of drought-sensitive conifer monocultures maintains timber production in the short term and enhances a range of forest diversity indices. Using uneven-aged forest management that targets a drought-adapted, diverse, and resilient species mixture, high species diversity can be combined with timber production in the long term. Yet, the promotion of mature-stand attributes requires management restrictions. Selecting future adaptive management options thus implies the consideration of trade-offs between forest resource use and environmental objectives, but also the exploitation of synergies between FGS that occur during forest conversion. Lastly, the large impact of past management practices on the spatial heterogeneity of forest dynamics underpins the need to assess FGS provisioning at the landscape scale. {\textcopyright} 2012 by the Ecological Society of America.},

It affects plant growth and survival, hence determining the nature of the vegetation, and wildlife habitat. A plethora of different techniques have been devised to measure the canopy. Evaluation of the litera- ture reveals confusion over what is actually being measured. This paper distinguishes two basic types of measurement: canopy cover is the area of the ground covered by a vertical projection of the canopy, while canopy closure is the proportion of the sky hemisphere obscured by vegetation when viewed from a single point. The principal techniques used to measure canopy cover, canopy closure, and a number of related measures are described and discussed. The advantages and limitations are outlined and some sampling guidelines are provided. The authors hope to clarify the nature of the measurements and to provide foresters with sufficient information to select techniques suitable for their needs.},

Alternatively, the keystone individual concept from behavioral ecology posits that a single individual with an extreme phenotype can have disproportionate and irreplaceable effects on group dynamics. Here, I generalize this concept to include nonbehavioral traits and broader ecological and evolutionary dynamics. I test for the effects of individuals with extreme phenotypes on the ecology and evolution of a gall-forming fly and its natural enemies that select for opposite gall sizes. Specifically, I introduce a putatively keystone predator-attracting individual gall-maker, hypothesizing that the presence of such an individual should (1) increase gall maker population-level mortality, (2) cause consumer communities to be dominated by species that are most attracted to the keystone individual, (3) increase selection for traits conferring de...},

abstract = {As the data resulting from modern genotyping tools are astoundingly complex, genotyping studies require great care in the sampling design, genotyping, data analysis and interpretation. Such care is necessary because, with data sets containing thousands of loci, small biases can easily become strongly significant patterns. Such biases may already be present in routine tasks that are present in almost every genotyping study. Here, I discuss seven common mistakes that can be frequently encountered in the genotyping literature: (i) giving more attention to genotyping than to sampling, (ii) failing to perform or report experimental randomization in the laboratory, (iii) equating geopolitical borders with biological borders, (iv) testing significance of clustering output, (v) misinterpreting Mantel's r statistic, (vi) only interpreting a single value of k and (vii) forgetting that only a small portion of the genome will be associated with climate. For every of those issues, I give some suggestions how to avoid the mistake. Overall, I argue that genotyping studies would benefit from establishing a more rigorous experimental design, involving proper sampling design, randomization and better distinction of a priori hypotheses and exploratory analyses.},

abstract = {Reintroduction has been recognized as a powerful conservation tool, but in order to ensure its success, animal monitoring is highly recommended. One way to monitor released animals is to put radiotelemetry collars on them. These devices, however, can harm the subjects, causing serious wounds. Our objectives in this work were to describe the injuries caused by a radiotelemetry collar model on reintroduced agoutis and to propose modifications to it. We equipped agoutis with TXE-311C radio collars (Telenax Wildlife Telemetry) before releasing them in the wild. They acquired serious wounds and one animal died. We then modified the collar structure to reduce its width and retention of water. After these modifications, the injuries did not occur again. As reintroduction is an expensive conservation strategy, any improvement that maximize its probability of success is important. We believe that the improvements we propose here have the potential to enhance the success of reintroductions and to increase animal welfare. This recommendation is more important when captive animals are re-introduced, because they tend to have lower immunity, particularly when they are released in rainy habitats},

abstract = {The measurement of plant dispersal is vital for understanding plant distribution and abundance at different scales. However, dispersal is difficult to measure and there is a lack of guidance for researchers new to the subject. In this paper we provide advice on methods for measuring dispersal in the field and approaches to experimental design. First, we encourage clear exposition of the aims of the dispersal study and the ultimate use to which the data will be put (e.g. local dynamics, invasion processes, etc). We outline the types of dispersal exhibited by plants and emphasise that many species are dispersed by multiple processes, which are not necessarily related to putative adaptations. Few studies properly address the full range of processes by which a species is dispersed. We review methods for measuring plant dispersal, summarising the type of dispersal measured and problems with each method. We then outline the major questions about effort to be considered in sampling protocols and present an optimisation algorithm for designing dispersal studies given a suite of options, and biological and resource constraints. We propose and demonstrate a simulation modelling approach to comparing the data quality obtained by alternative experimental designs. Inte grating simulation models with pilot studies offers a rapid route to improved estimation methods. We then discuss functions commonly fit to dispersal data and recommend caution as none is a priori the best description of the dispersal process. Finally, we call for a better description and understanding of dispersal kernels by: a more rigorous approach to designing dispersal measurement; better targeting of dispersal studies to particular questions; and achieving a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying dis persal, so that we can move from descriptions of pattern to a grasp of process.},

abstract = {Increasing biodiversity loss due to climate change is one of the most vital challenges of the 21st century. To anticipate and mitigate biodiversity loss, models are needed that reliably project species' range dynamics and extinction risks. Recently, several new approaches to model range dynamics have been developed to supplement correlative species distribution models (SDMs), but applications clearly lag behind model development. Indeed, no comparative analysis has been performed to evaluate their performance. Here, we build on process-based, simulated data for benchmarking five range (dynamic) models of varying complexity including classical SDMs, SDMs coupled with simple dispersal or more complex population dynamic models (SDM hybrids), and a hierarchical Bayesian process-based dynamic range model (DRM). We specifically test the effects of demographic and community processes on model predictive performance. Under current climate, DRMs performed best, although only marginally. Under climate change, predictive performance varied considerably, with no clear winners. Yet, all range dynamic models improved predictions under climate change substantially compared to purely correlative SDMs, and the population dynamic models also predicted reasonable extinction risks for most scenarios. When benchmarking data were simulated with more complex demographic and community processes, simple SDM hybrids including only dispersal often proved most reliable. Finally, we found that structural decisions during model building can have great impact on model accuracy, but prior system knowledge on important processes can reduce these uncertainties considerably. Our results reassure the clear merit in using dynamic approaches for modelling species' response to climate change but also emphasise several needs for further model and data improvement. We propose and discuss perspectives for improving range projections through combination of multiple models and for making these approaches operational for large numbers of species.},

abstract = {Although theory has demonstrated rather low levels of gene flow are sufficient to counteract opposing mutation, drift, and selection, widespread recognition of the evolutionary importance of gene flow has come slowly. The perceived role of gene flow as an evolutionary force has vacillated over the last century. In the last few decades, new methods and analyses have demonstrated that plant gene flow rates vary tremendously-from nil to very high-depending on the species and specific populations involved, and sometimes over time for individual populations. In many cases, the measured gene flow rates are evolutionarily significant at distances of hundreds and sometimes thousands of meters, occurring at levels sufficient to counteract drift, spread advantageous alleles, or thwart moderate levels of opposing local selection. Gene flow in plants is likely to often act as a cohesive force, uniting individual plant species into real evolutionary units. Also, gene flow can evolve under natural selection, decreasing or increasing. The fact of frequent, but variable, plant gene flow has important consequences for applied issues in which the presence or absence of gene flow might influence the outcome of a policy, regulatory, or management decision. Examples include the unintended spread of engineered genes, the evolution of invasiveness, and conservation. New data-rich genomic techniques allow closer scrutiny of the role of gene flow in plant evolution. Most plant evolutionists now recognize the importance of gene flow, and it is receiving increased recognition from other areas of plant biology as well. {\textcopyright} 2014 Botanical Society of America.},

The aim of this study was to evaluate the genetic structure of the current A. araucana populations in Chile, to verify the possible genetic divergence between Coastal and Andean populations and to assess whether bottleneck events have influenced habitat fragmentation and threaten the genetic resources and evolutionary potential of the species. Twelve natural populations, nine from the Andes Cordillera and three from the Coast Cordillera were analysed by means of eight genomic microsatellite markers developed in A. araucana. Results of analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) highlighted significant differentiation between Coastal and Andean populations (16 {\%}; P = 0.004), detecting one significant barrier that separated populations from both Cordilleras as maximally differentiated areas. At local scale, both ranges revealed significant inter-population differentiation, with higher values for Coastal populations compared with Andean populations. These results suggested the presence of four gene pools (three in the Andes and one in the Coast Cordilleras) and one population (VIL) in the Coast Cordillera that differed to the rest. The differentiation between the Andean and Coastal populations may provide important baseline data that should allow further studies of landscape genetics in the species and that can contribute to develop conservation strategies for its genetic resources.},

As IWM requires potentially deep changes in the cropping systems, modifying e.g. the crop sequence, the strategies for soil tillage and eventually introducing mechanical weeding, it is important to perform comprehensive evaluations of IWM-based cropping system prototypes. In this study, a Life Cycle Assessment method was used to compute several environmental impacts for four variants of IWM-based cropping system tested over a pluri-annual experiment, and compared with a standard reference. When expressed per unit of cultivated area, most environmental indicators were improved in IWM-based systems, including the energy input, greenhouse gas emission, eutrophication and acidification, and ecotoxicity and human toxicity. In-field fuel consumption was a rather minor contribution to the overall energy demand and to global warming. The ranking of the tested cropping systems was different when the indicators were expressed per unit of harvested agricultural goods or per unit of farmer's income. With these two functional units, the differences among systems tended to be weaker, and some indicators of environmental impacts were higher in IWM-based systems. Indicators focusing on biodiversity and soil quality displayed few differences among systems. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Increasing aridity as a result of climate change is expected to exacerbate tree mortality. Reducing forest basal area – the cross-sectional area of tree stems within a given ground area – can decrease tree competition, which may reduce drought-induced tree mortality. However, neither the magnitude of expected mortality increases, nor the potential effectiveness of basal area reduction, has been quantified in dryland forests such as those of the drought-prone Southwest US. We used thousands of repeatedly measured forest plots to show that unusually warm and dry conditions are related to high tree mortality rates and that mortality is positively related to basal area. Those relationships suggest that while increasing high temperature extremes forecasted by climate models may lead to elevated tree mortality during the 21st century, future tree mortality might be partly ameliorated by reducing stand basal area. This adaptive forest management strategy may provide a window of opportunity for forest managers and policy makers to guide forest transitions to species and/or genotypes more suited to future climates.},

abstract = {While forest management strongly influences biodiversity, it remains unclear how the structural and compositional changes caused by management affect different community dimensions (e.g. richness, specialisation, abundance or completeness) and how this differs between taxa. We assessed the effects of nine forest features (representing stand structure, heterogeneity and tree composition) on thirteen above- and belowground trophic groups of plants, animals, fungi and bacteria in 150 temperate forest plots differing in their management type. Canopy cover decreased light resources, which increased community specialisation but reduced overall diversity and abundance. Features increasing resource types and diversifying microhabitats (admixing of oaks and conifers) were important and mostly affected richness. Belowground groups responded differently to those aboveground and had weaker responses to most forest features. Our results show that we need to consider forest features rather than broad management types and highlight the importance of considering several groups and community dimensions to better inform conservation.},

abstract = {Ecological theory suggests that spatial distribution of biodiversity is strongly driven by community assembly processes. Thus the study of diversity patterns combined with null model testing has become increasingly common to infer assembly processes from observed distributions of diversity indices. However, results in both empirical and simulation studies are inconsistent. The aim of our study is to determine with simulated data which facets of biodiversity, if any, may unravel the processes driving its spatial patterns, and to provide practical considerations about the combination of diversity indices that would produce significant and congruent signals when using null models. The study is based on simulated species' assemblages that emerge under various landscape structures in a spatially explicit individual-based model with contrasting, predefined assembly processes. We focus on four assembly processes (species-sorting, mass effect, neutral dynamics and competition colonization trade-off) and investigate the emerging species' distributions with varied diversity indices (alpha, beta and gamma) measured at different spatial scales and for different diversity facets (taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic). We find that 1) the four assembly processes result in distinct spatial distributions of species under any landscape structure, 2) a broad range of diversity indices allows distinguishing between communities driven by different assembly processes, 3) null models provide congruent results only for a small fraction of diversity indices and 4) only a combination of these diversity indices allows identifying the correct assembly processes. Our study supports the inference of assembly processes from patterns of diversity only when different types of indices are combined. It highlights the need to combine phylogenetic, functional and taxonomic diversity indices at multiple spatial scales to effectively infer underlying assembly processes from diversity patterns by illustrating how combination of different indices might help disentangling the complex question of coexistence.},

abstract = {Ecological theory has been dominated by a focus on long-term or asymptotic behavior as a way to understand natural systems. Yet experiments are done on much shorter timescales, and the relevant timescales for ecological systems can also be relatively short. Thus, there is a mismatch between the timescales of most experiments and the timescales of many theoretical investigations. However, recent work has emphasized the importance of transient dynamics rather than long-term behavior in ecological systems, enabling the examination of forces that allow coexistence on ecological timescales. Through an examination of what leads to transients in ecological systems, a deeper appreciation of the forces leading to persistence or coexistence in ecological systems emerges, as well as a general understanding of how population levels can change through time.},

abstract = {In the coming century, forecast climate changes caused by increasing greenhouse gases may produce dramatic shifts in tree species distributions and the rates at which individual tree species sequester carbon or release carbon back to the atmosphere. The species composition and carbon storage capacity of northern Wisconsin (USA) forests are expected to change significantly as a result. Projected temperature changes are relatively large (up to a 5.8 C increase in mean annual temperature) and these forests encompass a broad ecotone that may be particularly sensitive to climate change. Our objective was to estimate the combined effects of climate change, common disturbances, and species migrations on regional forests using spatially interactive simulations. Multiple scenarios were simulated for 200 years to estimate aboveground live biomass and tree species composition. We used a spatially interactive forest landscape model (LANDIS-II) that includes individual tree species, biomass accumulation and decomposition, windthrow, harvesting, and seed dispersal. We used data from two global circulation models, the Hadley Climate Centre (version 2) and the Canadian Climate Center (version 1) to generate transient growth and decomposition parameters for 23 species. The two climate change scenarios were compared with a control scenario of continuing current climate conditions. The results demonstrate how important spatially interactive processes will affect the aboveground live biomass and species composition of northern Wisconsin forests. Forest composition, including species richness, is strongly affected by harvest- ing, windthrow, and climate change, although five northern species (Abies balsamea, Betula papyrifera, Picea glauca, Pinus banksiana, P. resinosa) are lost in both climate scenarios regardless of disturbance scenario. Changes in aboveground live biomass over time are nonlinear and vary among ecoregions. Aboveground live biomass will be significantly reduced because of species dispersal and migration limitations. The expected shift towards southern oaks and hickory is delayed because of seed dispersal limitations.},

abstract = {Tropical forests continue to be felled and fragmented around the world. A key question is how rapidly species disappear from forest fragments and how quickly humans must restore forest connectivity to minimize extinctions. We surveyed small mammals on forest islands in Chiew Larn Reservoir in Thailand 5 to 7 and 25 to 26 years after isolation and observed the near-total loss of native small mammals within 5 years from {\textless}10-hectare (ha) fragments and within 25 years from 10- to 56-ha fragments. Based on our results, we developed an island biogeographic model and estimated mean extinction half-life (50{\%} of resident species disappearing) to be 13.9 years. These catastrophic extinctions were probably partly driven by an invasive rat species; such biotic invasions are becoming increasingly common in human-modified landscapes. Our results are thus particularly relevant to other fragmented forest landscapes and suggest that small fragments are potentially even more vulnerable to biodiversity loss than previously thought.},

abstract = {There is currently anincreasing societal and political shift towards more sustainable agricultural systems toprovide both food production and ecological biodiversity levels. This shift has recently modified scientific questioning and brought up new research challenges for agro-ecological research. This is the case in particular for weed management, where issues have so far largely focused on the conflict between weeds and crop productivity. Here, we review recent findings that have led to a changing perception on weeds in agro-ecosystems and upcoming areas in terms of weed management options. Our main findings are that weeds have numerous interactions with other organisms and, in turn, some of these interactions can have direct, either negative or positive, effects on the functioning of the agro-ecosystem.Many interactions are species-specific, and therefore assessing the role of weed communities in the agro-ecosystem would benefit from further development in the functional grouping of weed species. In terms of weed management our review shows that alternative cropping systems can deliver both good levels of crop productivity and of weed management at the field level.Weeds respond to landscape attributes and there is a need to fully assess the scope for utilizingthe spatio-temporal organization of cropping systems and uncultivated habitats as a tool for minimizing weed infestations.Weeds are also submitted to biological regulation through the predation of their seedsand further research is required to assess the effect of cropping systems and landscape on levels of weed natural enemies, and therefore on the potential contribution of biological regulation in the management of weeds. ecosystem},

abstract = {The perfect-plasticity approximation (PPA) is an analytically tractable model of forest dynamics, defined in terms of parameters for individual trees, including allometry, growth, and mortality. We estimated these parameters for the eight most common species on each of four soil types in the US Lake states (Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota) by using short-term ({\textless}/=15-year) inventory data from individual trees. We implemented 100-year PPA simulations given these parameters and compared these predictions to chronosequences of stand development. Predictions for the timing and magnitude of basal area dynamics and ecological succession on each soil were accurate, and predictions for the diameter distribution of 100-year-old stands were correct in form and slope. For a given species, the PPA provides analytical metrics for early-successional performance (H(20), height of a 20-year-old open-grown tree) and late-successional performance (Z*, equilibrium canopy height in monoculture). These metrics predicted which species were early or late successional on each soil type. Decomposing Z* showed that (i) succession is driven both by superior understory performance and superior canopy performance of late-successional species, and (ii) performance differences primarily reflect differences in mortality rather than growth. The predicted late-successional dominants matched chronosequences on xeromesic (Quercus rubra) and mesic (codominance by Acer rubrum and Acer saccharum) soil. On hydromesic and hydric soils, the literature reports that the current dominant species in old stands (Thuja occidentalis) is now failing to regenerate. Consistent with this, the PPA predicted that, on these soils, stands are now succeeding to dominance by other late-successional species (e.g., Fraxinus nigra, A. rubrum).},

abstract = {Ongoing and predicted global change makes understanding and predicting species' range shifts an urgent scientific priority. Here, we provide a synthetic perspective on the so far poorly understood effects of interspecific interactions on range expansion rates. We present theoretical foundations for how interspecific interactions may modulate range expansion rates, consider examples from empirical studies of biological invasions and natural range expansions as well as process-based simulations, and discuss how interspecific interactions can be more broadly represented in process-based, spatiotemporally explicit range forecasts. Theory tells us that interspecific interactions affect expansion rates via alteration of local population growth rates and spatial displacement rates, but also via effects on other demographic parameters. The best empirical evidence for interspecific effects on expansion rates comes from studies of biological invasions. Notably, invasion studies indicate that competitive dominance and release from specialized enemies can enhance expansion rates. Studies of natural range expansions especially point to the potential for competition from resident species to reduce expansion rates. Overall, it is clear that interspecific interactions may have important consequences for range dynamics, but also that their effects have received too little attention to robustly generalize on their importance. We then discuss how interspecific interactions effects can be more widely incorporated in dynamic modeling of range expansions. Importantly, models must describe spatiotemporal variation in both local population dynamics and dispersal. Finally, we derive the following guidelines for when it is particularly important to explicitly represent interspecific interactions in dynamic range expansion forecasts: if most interacting species show correlated spatial or temporal trends in their effects on the target species, if the number of interacting species is low, and if the abundance of one or more strongly interacting species is not closely linked to the abundance of the target species.},

abstract = {Aim Although many factors undoubtedly affect species geographic distributions, can a single, simple model nonetheless capture most of the spatial variation in the probability of presence/absence in a large set of species? For 482 North American tree species that occur east of the Rocky Mountains, we investigated the shape(s) of the relationship between the probability of occupancy of a given location and macroclimate, and its consistency among species and regions. Location North America. Methods Using Little's tree range maps, we tested four hypothetical shapes of response relating occupancy to climate: (1) high occupancy of all suitable climates; (2) threshold response (i.e. unsuitable climates exclude species, but within the thresholds, species presence is independent of climate); (3) occupancy is a bivariate normal function of annual temperature and precipitation; and (4) asymmetric limitation (i.e. abiotic factors set abrupt range limits in stressful climates only). Finally, we compared observed climatic niches with the occupancy of similar climates on off-shore islands as well as west of the Rockies. Results (a) Species' distributions in climatic space do not have strong thresholds, nor are they systematically skewed towards less stressful climates. (b) Occupancy can generally be described by a bivariate normal function of temperature and precipitation, with little or no interaction between the two variables. This model, averaged over all species, accounts for 82{\%} of the spatial variation in the probability of occupancy of a given area. (c) Occupied geographic ranges are typically ringed by unoccupied, but climatically suitable areas. (d) Observed climatic niche positions are largely conserved between regions. Main conclusions We conclude that, despite the complexities of species histories and biologies, to a first approximation most of the variation in their geographic distributions relates to climate, in similar ways for nearly all species. {\textcopyright} 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {We explore the issues relevant to those types of ecosystems containing new combinations of species that arise through human action, environmental change, and the impacts of the deliberate and inadvertent introduction of species from other regions. Novel ecosystems (also termed 'emerging ecosystems') result when species occur in combinations and relative abundances that have not occurred previously within a given biome. Key characteristics are novelty, in the form of new species combinations and the potential for changes in ecosystem functioning, and human agency, in that these ecosystems are the result of deliberate or inadvertent human action. As more of the Earth becomes transformed by human actions, novel ecosystems increase in importance, but are relatively little studied. Either the degradation or invasion of native or 'wild' ecosystems or the abandonment of intensively managed systems can result in the formation of these novel systems. Important considerations are whether these new systems are persistent and what values they may have. It is likely that it may be very difficult or costly to return such systems to their previous state, and hence consideration needs to be given to developing appropriate management goals and approaches.},

abstract = {Aim: The ability of tree species to track their climatic niche at rates comparable to global warming is of concern, particularly if they are constrained by local adaptation. If a species is locally adapted at its range margin, it could be beneficial for range expansion because it ensures that the genotypes colonizing new areas are the fittest, given that environmental conditions are more similar to the current ones. In trees, local adaptation can slow range expansion when climate change happens much faster than their ability to migrate. Location: Qu{\'{e}}bec, Canada. Time period: 2013–2015. Major taxa studied: Trees. Methods: We investigate experimentally a series of factors thought to constrain the seedling phase at the leading edge of the distribution of a dominant tree species, sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marshall.). We established a seed transplant experiment using six provenances, representing the latitudinal species range, and transplanted them to 12 sites within, at and beyond the current northern species range margin. Results: At present, northern provenances provide the best opportunity for establishment beyond the current range, where climatic conditions are more similar than those of the warmer central or southern portions of the species range. Establishment was highest within the species range, but survival rates were comparable to those at the range margin and beyond, regardless of provenance. We also found that the local climate was the most influential factor for early seedling establishment and survival; however, a lack of suitable microsites also significantly constrained recruitment. Main conclusions: Our study highlights the complex interaction between provenance, climate and microsite conditions that is required to ensure successful seedling recruitment. Although sugar maple is currently displaying evidence for local adaptation to facilitate range shifts, it could risk maladaptation in the future if the local climate warms beyond a threshold required to ensure seed germination and a lack of favourable microsite conditions beyond the range.},

abstract = {The metacommunity concept has the potential to integrate local and regional dynamics within a general community ecology framework. To this end, the concept must move beyond the discrete archetypes that have largely defined it (e.g. neutral vs. species sorting) and better incorporate local scale species interactions and coexistence mechanisms. Here, we present a fundamental reconception of the framework that explicitly links local coexistence theory to the spatial processes inherent to metacommunity theory, allowing for a continuous range of competitive community dynamics. These dynamics emerge from the three underlying processes that shape ecological communities: (1) density-independent responses to abiotic conditions, (2) density-dependent biotic interactions and (3) dispersal. Stochasticity is incorporated in the demographic realisation of each of these processes. We formalise this framework using a simulation model that explores a wide range of competitive metacommunity dynamics by varying the strength of the underlying processes. Using this model and framework, we show how existing theories, including the traditional metacommunity archetypes, are linked by this common set of processes. We then use the model to generate new hypotheses about how the three processes combine to interactively shape diversity, functioning and stability within metacommunities.},

abstract = {Process-based forest models generally have many parameters, multiple outputs of interest and a small underlying empirical database. These characteristics hamper parameterization. Bayesian calibration offers a solution to the calibration problem because it applies to models of any type or size. It provides parameter estimates, with measures of uncertainty and correlation among the parameters. The procedure begins by quantifying the uncertainty about parameter values in the form of a prior probability distribution. Then data on the output variables are used to update the parameter distribution by means of Bayes' Theorem. This yields a posterior calibrated distribution for the parameters, which can be summarized in the form of a mean vector and variance matrix. The predictive uncertainty of the model can be quantified by running it with different parameter settings, sampled from the posterior distribution. In a further step, one may evaluate the posterior probability of the model itself (rather than that of the parameters) and compare that against the probability of other models, to aid in model selection or improvement.$\backslash$nBayesian calibration of process-based models cannot be performed analytically, so the posterior parameter distribution must be approximated in the form of a representative sample of parameter values. This can be achieved by means of Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation, which is suitable for process-based models because of its simplicity and because it does not require advance knowledge of the shape of the posterior distribution.$\backslash$nDespite the suitability of Bayesian calibration, the technique has rarely been used in forestry research. We introduce the method, using the example of a typical forest model. Further, we show that reductions in parameter uncertainty, and thus in output uncertainty, can be effected by increasing the variety of data, increasing the accuracy of measurements and increasing the length of time series.},

abstract = {Over the past century, the Brazilian Atlantic forest has been reduced to small, isolated fragments of forest. Reproductive isolation theories predict a loss of genetic diversity and increases in inbreeding and spatial genetic structure (SGS) in such populations. We analysed eight microsatellite loci to investigate the pollen and seed dispersal patterns, genetic diversity, inbreeding and SGS of the tropical tree Copaifera langsdorffii in a small (4.8 ha), isolated population. All 112 adult trees and 128 seedlings found in the stand were sampled, mapped and genotyped. Seedlings had significantly lower levels of genetic diversity (A=16.5±0.45, mean95{\%} s.e.; H e=0.838±0.006) than did adult trees (A=23.2±0.81; H e=0.893±0.030). Parentage analysis did not indicate any seed immigration (m seeds = 0) and the pollen immigration rate was very low (m pollen = 0.047). The average distance of realized pollen dispersal within the stand was 94 m, with 81{\%} of the pollen travelling 150 m. A significant negative correlation was found between the frequency and distance of pollen dispersal (r = -0.79, P=0.01), indicating that short-distance pollinations were more frequent. A significant SGS for both adults (50 m) and seedlings (20 m) was also found, indicating that most of the seeds were dispersed over short distances. The results suggested that the spatial isolation of populations by habitat fragmentation can restrict seed and pollen gene flow, increase SGS and affect the genetic diversity of future generations. {\textcopyright} 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The vegetation in the southern Brazilian highlands is characterized by Araucaria forest and Campos grassland. Evidences indicate that Araucaria forest is currently expanding over grassland and that this expansion may occur by nucleation or edge dynamics. Nucleation mechanisms of Araucaria forest expansion are well documented, whereas mechanisms of expansion starting from the forest edge are not. In this study, we aimed (1) to assess how prominent is Araucaria forest expansion over Campos grassland starting from the forest edge, and (2) to discuss about the possible mechanisms underlying sapling community colonization in grassland. We conducted our sampling in 11 transects disposed from the forest edge towards the grassland. The transects were distributed in four study sites. Each transect was 50 m long and was divided into 25 plots with area of 8 m. All forest woody sapling individuals were identified and registered. We considered distance from forest edge, presence of dead shrubs, Baccharis uncinella cover, nurse tree cover and rock cover as predictors of forest plant abundance and composition. Niche and distance contribution on the explanation of sapling composition and abundance were partitioned using, respectively, canonical correspondence analysis and multiple regressions. Cover of nurse trees explained almost 31{\%} of total variation in sapling abundance, followed by the distance from the forest edge that explained 6.9{\%}. Site explained 7.6{\%} of total variation in sapling species composition, followed by distance from the forest edge, which explained 2.3{\%}, whereas niche had a minor (2.1{\%}) and non-significant proportion of variation explanation. Our findings show that Araucaria forest expansion over native grasslands in southern Brazil relies deeply on the nurse plant effect. Previous studies have demonstrated that Araucaria forest forms nuclei scattered in the grassland where nurse plants or nurse rocks are established. Here, we bring evidences that nurse plants are important also to the tree encroachment starting closer to the forest edge. This study provides new information on the mechanisms involved in the forest expansion over native grasslands.},

abstract = {1. Assessing dispersal events in plants faces important challenges and limitations. A methodological issue that limits advances in our understanding of seed dissemination by frugivorous animals is identifying ‘which species dispersed the seeds'. This is essential for assessing how multiple frugivore species contribute distinctly to critical dispersal events such as seed delivery to safe sites, long-distance dispersal and the colonization of non-occupied habitats. 2. Here,we describe DNA-barcoding protocols successfully applied to bird-dispersed seeds sampled in the field. AvianDNAwas extracted from the surface of defecated or regurgitated seeds, allowing the identification of the frugivore species that contributed each dispersal event. Disperser species identification was based on a 464-bp mitochondrialDNAregion (COI: cytochrome c oxidase subunit I). 3. We illustrate the possible applications of this method with bird-dispersed seeds sampled in the field. DNA-barcoding provides a non-invasive technique that allows quantifying frugivory and seed dispersal interac- tion networks, assessing the contribution of each frugivore species to seed rain in different microhabitats, and testingwhether different frugivore species select different fruit/seed sizes. 4. DNA barcoding of animal-dispersed seeds can resolve the distribution of dispersal services provided by diverse frugivore assemblages, allowing a robust and precise estimation of the different components of seed dis- persal effectiveness, previously unattainable to traditional field studies at individual seed level. Given that seeds are sampled at the end of the dispersal process, this technique enables us to link the identity of the disperser spe- cies responsible for each dispersal event to plant traits and environmental features, thereby building a bridge between frugivory and seed deposition patterns.},

Disturbance may provide important constraints on distributions in limited contexts. Overall, historic and contemporary evidence suggests that species distributions are strongly influenced by climate, yet examples of disequilib- rium with climate abound.

Predicting ecological and biogeographic responses to these changes constitutes an immense challenge for ecologists. Perspectives from climatic and ecological history indicate that responses will be laden with contingencies, resulting from episodic climatic events interacting with demographic and colonization events. This effect is compounded by the dependency of environmental sensitivity upon life-stage for many species. Climate variables often used in empirical niche models may become decoupled from the proximal variables that directly influence individuals and populations. Greater predictive capacity, and more-fundamental ecological and biogeographic understanding, will come from integration of correlational niche modeling with mechanistic niche modeling, dynamic ecological modeling, targeted experiments, and systematic observations of past and present patterns and dynamics.},

abstract = {To understand why and how species invade ecosystems, ecologists have made heavy use of observations of species colonization on islands. The theory of island biogeography, developed in the 1960s by R.H. MacArthur and E.O. Wilson, has had a tremendous impact on how ecologists understand the link between species diversity and characteristics of the habitat such as isolation and size. Recent developments have described how the inclusion of information on trophic interactions can further inform our understanding of island biogeography dynamics. Here, we extend the trophic theory of island biogeography to assess whether certain food web properties on the mainland affect colonization/extinction dynamics of species on islands. Our results highlight that both food web connectance and size on the mainland increase species diversity on islands. We also highlight that more heavily tailed degree distributions in the mainland food web correlate with less frequent but potentially more important extinction cascades on islands. The average shortest path to a basal species on islands follows a hump-shaped curve as a function of realized species richness, with food chains slightly longer than on the mainland at intermediate species richness. More modular mainland webs are also less persistent on islands. We discuss our results in the context of global changes and from the viewpoint of community assembly rules, aiming at pinpointing further theoretical developments needed to make the trophic theory of island biogeography even more useful for fundamental and applied ecology.},

abstract = {Habitat fragmentation contributes to the decline of plant species by decreasing gene flow among populations. Restoring connectivity among habitat patches is therefore a major issue for plant conservation. However, deciding where to focus restoration efforts requires identifying suitable dispersers for each target plant species. We collected data from the literature on wild and domesticated ungulates, known to be effective seed dispersers, and on the plants they dispersed in Europe via epi- and/or endozoochory. We performed a systematic literature review to identify plant and animal traits relevant for seed dispersal. We first modeled the relationships between epi- or endozoochory and a priori selected plant traits (diaspore releasing height, length, shape and morphology, and habitat openness). The differences we underlined between the two dispersal mechanisms justified splitting our analyses accordingly. Then, for each dispersal mechanism, we asked whether basic plant traits could be used to predict specific traits of ungulates as endozoochorous or epizoochorous seed dispersers. We modeled the relationships between a priori selected ungulate traits for epizoochory (habitat openness, shoulder height, hair curliness, and hair length) and for endozoochory (habitat openness, body mass, feeding type and digestive system) and plant traits. Plant habitat openness and diaspore morphology were the predictors that most often explained differ- ences among ungulates for epizoochory, whereas plant habitat openness and diaspore releasing height most often explained differences for endozoochory. Our trait-based predictive models can help improve our ability to propose more precise management decisions for the conservation of plant populations worldwide by taking into account ungulate dispersers.},

abstract = {Extensive realized pollen and seed flow across populations reduces inbreeding and spatial genetic structure (SGS) and increases the genetic diversity and effective size within populations. Inbreeding, SGS and realized patterns of pollen and seed dispersal of the dioecious, wind pollinated Araucaria angustifolia were investigated based on microsatellite loci. The study was conducted in a 7.2 ha plot established within a continuous Araucaria Forest in Southern Brazil. In the plot, all 290 adult trees were mapped, measured (diameter at breast height, dbh), sexed, sampled and genotyped. We also sampled, measured (total height), mapped and genotyped 223 juveniles. A total of 86 alleles were detected in the sample (n = 513). Adults and juveniles showed a positive and significant fixation index (minimum of 0.096), suggesting inbreeding or Wahlund effect. Juveniles presented a significant aggregated distribution which was associated with a genetic aggregation (significant SGS up to 20 m), indicating that near neighbor trees may be related due the limited seed dispersal. However, the intensity of SGS was not significantly higher among juveniles (Sp = 0.0041) than adults (Sp = 0.0026). Realized pollen and seed immigration into the plot was low (pollen = 6 {\%}; seeds = 5 {\%}) and the patterns of pollen and seed dispersal were similar. Pollen was dispersed over long distances (343 m), but 50 {\%} was dispersed up to 124 m. Seeds also reached long distances (318 m), with 50 {\%} being dispersed up to 133 m. Our results are discussed in terms of auto-ecology and the genetic conservation of A. angustifolia populations. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract = {Public perceptions of climate change are known to differ between nations and to have fluctuated over time. Numerous plausible characterizations of these variations, and explanations for them, are to be found in the literature. However, a clear picture has not yet emerged as to the principal trends and patterns that have occurred over the past quarter-century or the factors behind these changes. This systematic review considers previous empirical research that has addressed the temporal aspects to public perceptions. We address findings that have been obtained since the 1980s and using a range of methodologies. In this review, we consider early, seminal work examining public perceptions; survey studies carried out over long timescales and at an international scale; detailed statistical analyses of the drivers of changing perceptions; and qualitative research featuring a longitudinal component. Studies point to growing skepticism in the latter 2000s in some developed countries, underpinned by economic and sociopolitical factors. Even so, in many parts of the world, there has been growing concern about climate change in recent years. We conclude that the imbalance in the literature toward polling data, and toward studies of public perceptions in Western nations (particularly the United States), leaves much unknown about the progression of public understanding of climate change worldwide. More research is required that uses inferential statistical procedures to understand the reasons behind trends in public perceptions. The application of qualitative longitudinal methodologies also offers the potential for better appreciation of the cultural contexts in which climate change perceptions are evolving.},

We derive a plant-based metaecosystem model to analyze how the spatial flows of the biotic and abiotic forms of a limiting nutrient affect persistence and coexistence. We show that the proportion of patches supporting plants in a region has a considerable impact on local nutrient dynamics. Then we explicitly couple nutrient dynamics to patch dynamics. Our model shows strong feedback between local and regional dynamics mediated by nutrient flows. We find that nutrient flows can have either positive or negative effects on species persistence and coexistence. The essential feature of this local-regional coupling is the net direction of the nutrient flows between occupied and empty patches. A net flow of nutrients from occupied to empty patches leads to indirect facilitative interactions, such as an inferior competitor promoting the persistence of a superior competitor. We show that nutrient flows affect the potential diversity of the metaecosystem and key features of plant community dynamics, such as the shape of the competition-colonization trade-off and successional sequences. Our analysis revealed that integrating ecosystem and spatial dynamics can lead to various indirect interactions that contribute significantly to community organization.},

There is currently no model that quantifies vegetation resistance and resilience at a global scale while simultaneously taking climate variability into account. The goals of this study were therefore to develop a standardized indicator of short-term vegetation resilience and resistance to drought and temperature anomalies, and to improve our understanding of vegetation resistance and resilience in drought-sensitive areas by linking metrics of vegetation stability to the percentage of tree cover, non-tree vegetation and bare soil. Location: Global. Methods: The deviation of vegetation behaviour from expectations was quantified using anomalies in the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and modelled as a function of (1) past NDVI anomalies, (2) an instantaneous drought indicator and (3) temperature anomalies. Metrics of resistance and resilience were then extracted from the model and related to the percentages of bare soil, non-tree vegetation and tree cover. Results: Comparisons of the globally derived resilience and resistance metrics showed low resilience and low resistance to drought in semi-arid areas, low resistance to negative temperature anomalies in high-latitude areas, and low resistance to positive temperature anomalies in the Sahel and Australia. In drought-sensitive areas, resilience was highest for vegetation types with 3-20{\%} bare soil and 5-15{\%} tree cover. Main conclusions: Our ARx model is the first to simultaneously derive vegetation resistance and resilience metrics at a global scale, explicitly taking into account the spatial variability of short-term climate anomalies and data reliability. Its results highlight the impact of tree cover, non-tree vegetation and bare soil on vegetation resilience.},

abstract = {Tropical trees often display long-distance pollen dispersal, even in highly fragmented landscapes. Understanding how patterns of spatial isolation influence pollen dispersal and interact with background patterns of fine-scale spatial genetic structure (FSGS) is critical for evaluating the genetic consequences of habitat fragmentation. In the endangered tropical timber tree Dysoxylum malabaricum (Meliaceae), we apply eleven microsatellite markers with paternity and parentage analysis to directly estimate historic gene flow and contemporary pollen dispersal across a large area (216-�km2) in a highly fragmented agro-forest landscape. A comparison of genetic diversity and genetic structure in adult and juvenile life stages indicates an increase in differentiation and FSGS over time. Paternity analysis and parentage analysis demonstrate high genetic connectivity across the landscape by pollen dispersal. A comparison between mother trees in forest patches with low and high densities of adult trees shows that the frequency of short-distance mating increases, as does average kinship among mates in low-density stands. This indicates that there are potentially negative genetic consequences of low population density associated with forest fragmentation. Single isolated trees, in contrast, frequently receive heterogeneous pollen from distances exceeding 5-�km. We discuss the processes leading to the observed patterns of pollen dispersal and the implications of this for conservation management of D.-�malabaricum and tropical trees more generally},

abstract = {Agricultural equipment can disperse weed seeds over large distances. Efforts to minimize or prevent equipment-mediated dispersal should be a key component in any integrated weed management plan. Several experiments were initiated in commercial wild blueberry fields to examine the potential impact of harvesting equipment on weed seed dispersal within and between blueberry fields. Seed loads were examined on harvesting equipment between fields and results suggest that harvesting equipment is a major vector of seed dispersal. Seed loads were 397,000 in 2006 and 194,000 in 2007. Of all seeds located on the harvester, 66 to 79{\%} were located on the belts or affiliated components. In 2006, a second experiment was established to examine within-field seed dispersal. A sampling grid was established over multiple distinct poverty oatgrass patches with seed heads at 44{\%} of all sampling points. Following harvest, seeds were located at 67{\%} of all sampling points. In 2006 and 2007, short-distance secondary dispersal of poverty oatgrass by harvesting equipment was measured. The relationship between distance from patch perimeter and seeds per unit area on the side approached by harvesting equipment and the far side of the patch was adequately modeled with an exponential decay model. Secondary dispersal within blueberry fields by harvesting equipment is inevitable. Dispersal may be reduced by avoiding dense weed patches, or altering harvest timing. Periodic cleaning of harvesting equipment between fields will help prevent the spread of weed seed},

abstract = {Aim: We analysed spatial datasets of abundance across the entirety, or near entirety, of the geographical ranges of 134 tree species to test macroecological hypotheses concerning the distribution of abundance across geographical ranges. Location: Our abundance estimates came via the USDA Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis Eastwide Database, which contains data for 134 eastern North American tree species. Methods: We extracted measures of range size and the spatial location of abundance relative to position in the range for each species to test four hypotheses: (a) species occur in low abundance throughout most of their geographical range; (b) there is a positive interspecific relationship between abundance and range size; (c) species are more abundant in the centre of their range; and (d) there is a bimodal distribution of spatial autocorrelation in abundance across a species range. Results: Our results demonstrate that (a) most species (85{\%}) are abundant somewhere in their geographical range; (b) species achieving relatively high abundance tend to have larger range sizes; (c) the widely held assumption that species exhibit an 'abundant-centre distribution' is not well supported for the majority of species; we suggest 'abundant-core' as a more suitable term; and (d) there is no evidence of a bimodal distribution of spatial autocorrelation in abundance. Main Conclusions: For many tree species, high abundance can be achieved at any position in the range, though suitable sites are found with less frequency towards range edges. Competitive relationships may be involved in the distribution of abundance across tree ranges and species with larger ranges (and possibly broader niches) may be affected more by biotic interactions than smaller ranging species. {\textcopyright} 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Species distribution in a metacommunity varies according to their traits, the distribution of environmental conditions and connectivity among localities. These ingredients contribute to coexistence across spatial scales via species sorting, patch dynamics, mass effects and neutral dynamics. These mechanisms however seldom act in isolation and the impact of landscape configuration on their relative importance remains poorly understood. We present a new model of metacommunity dynamics that simultaneously considers these four possible mechanisms over spatially explicit landscapes and propose a statistical approach to partition their contribution to species distribution. We find that landscape configuration can induce dispersal limitations that have negative consequences for local species richness. This result was more pronounced with neutral dynamics and mass effect than with species sorting or patch dynamics. We also find that the relative importance of the four mechanisms varies not only among landscape configurations, but also among species, with some species being mostly constrained by dispersal and/or drift and others by sorting. Changes in landscape properties might lead to a shift in coexistence mechanisms and, by extension, to a change in community composition. This confirms the importance of considering landscape properties for conservation and management. Our results illustrate the idea that ecological communities are the results of multiple mechanisms acting at the same time and complete our understanding of spatial processes in competitive metacommunities.This article is protected by copyright.

abstract = {Paternity inference using highly polymorphic codominant markers is becoming common in the study of natural populations. However, multiple males are often found to be genetically compatible with each offspring tested, even when the probability of excluding an unrelated male is high. While various methods exist for evaluating the likelihood of paternity of each nonexcluded male, interpreting these likelihoods has hitherto been difficult, and no method takes account of the incomplete sampling and error-prone genetic data typical of large-scale studies of natural systems. We derive likelihood ratios for paternity inference with codominant markers taking account of typing error, and define a statistic A for resolving paternity. Using allele frequencies from the study population in question, a simulation program generates criteria for A that permit assignment of paternity to the most likely male with a known level of statistical confidence. The simulation takes account of the number of candidate males, the proportion of males that are sampled and gaps and errors in genetic data. We explore the potentially confounding effect of relatives and show that the method is robust to their presence under commonly encountered conditions. The method is demonstrated using genetic data from the intensively studied red deer (Cervus elaphus) population on the island of Rum, Scotland. The Windows-based computer program, CERVUS+, described in this study is available from the authors. CERVUS can be used to calculate allele frequencies, run simulations and perform parentage analysis using data from all types of codominant markers.},

abstract = {Scientists need to compare the support for models based on observed phenomena. The main goal of the evidential paradigm is to quantify the strength of evidence in the data for a reference model relative to an alternative model. This is done via an evidence function, such as $\Delta$SIC, an estimator of the sample size scaled difference of divergences between the generating mechanism and the competing models. To use evidence, either for decision making or as a guide to the accumulation of knowledge, an understanding of the uncertainty in the evidence is needed. This uncertainty is well characterized by the standard statistical theory of estimation. Unfortunately, the standard theory breaks down if the models are misspecified, as is commonly the case in scientific studies. We develop non-parametric bootstrap methodologies for estimating the sampling distribution of the evidence estimator under model misspecification. This sampling distribution allows us to determine how secure we are in our evidential statement. We characterize this uncertainty in the strength of evidence with two different types of confidence intervals, which we term “global” and “local.” We discuss how evidence uncertainty can be used to improve scientific inference and illustrate this with a reanalysis of the model identification problem in a prominent landscape ecology study using structural equations.},

abstract = {It is often assumed that the geographic distributions of species match their climatic tolerances, but this assumption is not frequently tested. Moreover, few studies examine the relative importance of abiotic and biotic factors for limiting species ranges. We combined multiple approaches to assess the extent to which fitness of a widespread native annual legume, Chamaecrista fasciculata, decreases at and beyond its northern and western range edges, and how this is influenced by the presence of neighbors. First, we examined plant fitness and the effect of neighbors in natural populations at different geographic range locations for three years. Fitness decreased toward the northern range edge, but not the western edge. Neighbor removal had a consistently positive effect on seedpod production across all years and sites. Second, we established experimental populations at sites within the range, and at and beyond the northern and western range edges. We tracked individual fitness and recorded seedling recruitment in the following year (a complete generation) to estimate population growth rate. Individual fitness and population growth declined to near zero beyond both range edges, indicating that C. fasciculata with its present genetic composition will not establish in these regions, given conditions currently. We also carried out a neighbor removal treatment. Consistent with the natural populations, neighbors reduced seedpod production of reproductive adults. However, neighbors also increased early-season survival, and this positive effect early in life history resulted in a net positive effect of neighbors on lifetime fitness at most range locations. Our data show that the population growth rate of C. fasciculata includes values above replacement, and populations are well adapted to conditions up to the edge of the range, whereas the severely compromised fitness at sites beyond the edge precludes immediate establishment of populations and thereby impedes adaptation to these conditions. {\textcopyright} 2012 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract = {Due to its impact on local adaptation, population functioning or range shifts, dispersal is considered a central process for population persistence and species evolution. However, measuring dispersal is complicated, which justifies the use of dispersal proxies. Although appealing, and despite its general relationship with dispersal, body size has however proven unsatisfactory as a dispersal proxy. Our hypothesis here is that, given the existence of dispersal syndromes, suites of life-history traits may be alternative, more appropriate proxies for dispersal. We tested this idea by using butterflies as a model system. We demonstrate that different elements of the dispersal process (i.e., individual movement rates, distances, and gene flow) are correlated with different suites of life-history traits: these various elements of dispersal form separate syndromes and must be considered real axes of a species' niche. We then showed that these syndromes allowed accurate predictions of dispersal. The use of life-history traits improved the precision of the inferences made from wing size alone by up to five times. Such trait-based predictions thus provided reliable dispersal inferences that can feed simulation models aiming at investigating the dynamics and evolution of butterfly populations, and possibly of other organisms, under environmental changes, to help their conservation.},

abstract = {Abstract: The spatial structure and evolution of river networks offer tremendous opportunities to study the processes underlying metacommunity patterns in the wild. Here we explore several fundamental aspects of aquatic plant biogeography. How stable is plant composition over time? How similar is it along rivers? How fast is the species turnover? How does that and spatial structure affect our species richness estimates across scales? How do climate change, river management practices and connectivity affect species composition and community structure? We answer these questions by testing twelve hypotheses and combining two spatial surveys across entire networks, a long term temporal survey (21 consecutive years), a trait database, and a selection of environmental variables. From our river reach scale survey in lowland rivers, hydrophytes and marginal plants (helophytes) showed contrasting patterns in species abundance, richness and autocorrelation both in time and space. Since patterns in marginal plants reflect at least partly a sampling artefact (edge effect), the rest of the study focused on hydrophytes. Seasonal variability over two years and positive temporal autocorrelation at short time lags confirmed the relatively high regeneration abilities of aquatic plants in lowland rivers. Yet, from 1978 to 1998, plant composition changed quite dramatically and diversity decreased substantially. The annual species turnover was relatively high (20{\%}–40{\%}) and cumulated species richness was on average 23{\%} and 34{\%} higher over three and five years respectively, than annual survey. The long term changes were correlated to changes in climate (decreasing winter ice scouring, increasing summer low flows) and management (riparian shading). Over 21 years, there was a general erosion of species attributes over time attributed to a decrease in winter ice scouring, increase in shading and summer low flows,...},

abstract = {1. Community-wide studies have shown that functional traits of tropical trees vary with soil- type preference, but few have examined trait diversification among closely related taxa. In this study, we asked how functional traits of adults and saplings within a speciose genus, Inga, differ in relation to their soil-type preferences. 2. We quantified soil-type preference and functional traits of nine Inga species (Fabaceae) in the wet tropical forest at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica, where rich alluvial soil and less fertile residual soil of volcanic origin occur in close proximity. 3. From the extensive trail network, we randomly selected 104 trail segments, each 50 m long, along which all Inga individuals {\textgreater}50 cm tall were counted and identified to species. Five and three common species showed significant bias to residual or alluvial soil, respectively, while the remaining one showed no significant bias. For these nine species, we quantified five leaf traits for saplings and adults, as well as wood-specific gravity (WSG) and three seed traits. 4. For both adults and saplings, leaf mass per area (LMA) and lamina density were higher for residual-soil specialists than fertile alluvial-soil specialists. The opposite trend was found for nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentrations in leaves. Lamina thickness did not differ between soil-type preference groups. All leaf trait values except N concentration increased from saplings to adults, with adults showing larger interspecific variations in trait values than saplings. 5. Saplings and adults of the single species found on both soils had trait values intermediate between residual and alluvial-soil specialists. 6. Seed mass and seed N, as well asWSG of adults, were higher in residual-soil specialists than alluvial-soil specialists. Higher seed N indicates higher maternal investment of species growing on less fertile soil. 7. These differences in traits among closely related species across continuous soils suggest that habitat filtering has contributed to the evolution of seed, juvenile and adult traits within a speciose tropical tree genus},

abstract = {While the wealth of projection matrices in plant demography permits comparative studies, variation in matrix dimensions complicates interspecific comparisons. Collapsing matrices to a common dimension may facilitate such comparisons but may also bias the inferred demographic parameters. Here we examine how matrix dimension affects inferred demographic elasticities and how different collapsing criteria perform. We analyzed 13 x 13 matrices representing nine plant species, collapsing these matrices (i) into even 7 x 7, 5 x 5, 4 x 4, and 3 x 3 matrices and (ii) into 5 x 5 matrices using different criteria. Stasis and fecundity elasticities increased when matrix dimension was reduced, whereas those of progression and retrogression decreased. We suggest a collapsing criterion that minimizes dissimilarities between the original- and collapsed-matrix elasticities and apply it to 66 plant species to study how life span and growth form influence the relationship between matrix dimension and elasticities. Our analysis demonstrates that (i) projection matrix dimension has significant effects on inferred demographic parameters, (ii) there are better-performing methods than previously suggested for standardizing matrix dimension, and (iii) herbaceous perennial projection matrices are particularly sensitive to changes in matrix dimensionality. For comparative demographic studies, we recommend normalizing matrices to a common dimension by collapsing higher classes and leaving the first few classes unaltered.},

Body size is often considered as a good indicator because of its relationship to extinction risk and several functional traits. Here, we examined the predictive capacity of species body size in marine and freshwater multitrophic systems. We found a significant, but weak, effect of body size on functioning. The effect was much stronger when considering the effect of body size within trophic position levels. Compared to extinctions ordered by body size, random extinction sequences had lower multiple species loss effects on functioning. Our study is the first to show experimentally, in multitrophic systems, a more negative impact of ordered extinction sequences on ecosystem functioning than random losses. Our results suggest apparent ease in predicting species loss effect on functioning based on easily measured ecological traits that are body size and trophic position.},

abstract = {Assisted migration has been proposed as a strategy for adaptive management of forest species in response to expected effects of climate change, but it is controversial for several reasons. Tropical dry forests are among the most threatened ecosystems in the world. In Mexico, historically, land-use change and deforestation have been decreasing forest cover, and climate change is shifting the potential distribution of different forest types, exacerbating the risk of local extinctions. Assisted altitudinal migration could be a feasible strategy for reducing local extinctions in response to climate change and lack of landscape connectivity. Our objective was to evaluate survival and growth of Albizia plurijuga and Ceiba aesculifolia, two tropical deciduous forests species in Mexico. We transplanted 4-month-old seedlings to experimental raised beds at three altitudes (2100, 2400 and 2700 m a.s.l.), exceeding their upper regional limit of distribution (2000 m a.s.l.). We also tested seed germination at each altitude. We monitored the experiment for 10 months. For both species, as altitude increased and cold weather was more prevalent, plant performance declined. Within species, differences in individual growth were significant among altitudes. Overall survival was 18.5{\%} for A. plurijuga and 24.5{\%} for C. aesculifolia. Both species had higher survival and better growth at lower altitude, and no seedling emergence at any altitude. We conclude that assisted migration can be implemented for each species by an upward attitudinal shift within, and not exceeding, 400 m beyond their present upper altitudinal limit of distribution. Our results indicate that for many species that show altitudinal gradients at regional scales, unless current climate conditions change, the potential to establish outside their range is minimal.},

abstract = {Despite recent advances in understanding tree species sensitivities to climate change, ecological knowledge on different species remains scattered across disparate sources, precluding their inclusion in vulnerability assessments. Information on potential sensitivities is needed to identify tree species that require consideration, inform changes to current silvicultural practices and prioritize management actions. A trait-based approach was used to overcome some of the challenges involved in assessing sensitivity, providing a common framework to facilitate data integration and species comparisons. Focusing on 26 abundant tree species from eastern Canada, we developed a series of trait-based indices that capture a species' ability to cope with three key climate change stressors-increased drought events, shifts in climatically suitable habitat, increased fire intensity and frequency. Ten indices were developed by breaking down species' response to a stressor into its strategies, mechanisms and traits. Species-specific sensitivities varied across climate stressors but also among the various ways a species can cope with a given stressor. Of the 26 species assessed, Tsuga canadensis (L.) Carri{\`{e}}re and Abies balsamea (L.) Mill are classified as the most sensitive species across all indices while Acer rubrum L. and Populus spp. are the least sensitive. Information was found for 95{\%} of the trait-species combinations but the quality of available data varies between indices and species. Notably, some traits related to individual-level sensitivity to drought were poorly documented as well as deciduous species found within the temperate biome. We also discuss how our indices compare with other published indices, using drought sensitivity as an example. Finally, we discuss how the information captured by these indices can be used to inform vulnerability assessments and the development of adaptation measures for species with different management requirements under climate change.},

We tested these contrasting predictions by transplanting low-, mid-, and high-elevation (edge) populations of an annual plant throughout and above its elevational distribution. Seed from poor-quality edge habitat (one of two transects) had inferior emergence, but edge seeds also had adaptive phenology (both transects). High-elevation plants flowered earlier, required less heat accumulation to mature seed, and so achieved higher lifetime fitness at and above the range edge. Experimental warming improved fitness above the range, but eliminated the advantage of local cold-edge populations, supporting recent models in which cold-adapted edge populations do not facilitate warming-induced range shifts. The highest above-range fitness was achieved by a ‘super edge phenotype' from a neighbouring mountain, suggesting key adaptations exist regionally even if absent from local edge populations.},

abstract = {1 In forest communities, species coexistence can be favoured by disturbance-related variations in light regime coupled with rank reversal in species performance. The objective of this study was to determine if a major canopy disturbance, resulting from an ice storm, would favour the coexistence of sugar maple (Acer saccharum) and beech (Fagus grandifolia) in an old-growth forest located near the northern limit of the species' range. 2 The growth, density and frequency of occurrence of understorey stems were evaluated 7 years after the ice storm and compared with pre-disturbance values to determine if sugar maple, a slightly less shade-tolerant species, would be favoured over beech. 3 Although height and radial growth increased three- to five-fold, and {\textgreater}70{\%} of the 5-10 cm d.b.h. stems showed a release, sugar maple did not benefit more from the opening of the canopy than beech. 4 The inability of sugar maple to outgrow beech might be related to the high proportion of beech root sprouts at our site, suggesting that the potential for the disturbance-mediated mechanism to slow the competitive exclusion of maple might decrease as the importance of vegetative reproduction increases in beech. 5 Prior to the disturbance, sugar maple was more abundant and occurred in a larger proportion of the plots among small size classes, while beech dominated in the larger size classes. Although some increases in the density of both species were detected after the disturbance, the general trends of relative abundance and distribution of the species were not modified significantly. 6 Our results do not indicate that a single canopy disturbance such as the major 1998 ice storm significantly favoured sugar maple over beech. When a disturbance opens the canopy, competition for light in gaps may tend to maintain or reinforce a pre-existing hierarchy instead of reversing it, especially when interspecific differences in post-disturbance growth are small or absent, as in this study. 7 This study shows that the dynamics of sugar maple - beech communities are more complex than previously envisaged and that revised models should incorporate additional factors (e.g. vegetative reproduction) that might also play an important role in regulating community dynamics.},

abstract = {In an effort to ensure the sustainability of their forests, boreal forest managers often use forest planning models to make future projections of timber supply and other key services, such as habitat for wildlife. Projecting the fate of these services has proven to be challenging, however, as major uncertainties exist regarding the principal drivers of boreal ecosystem dynamics, including the future spatial and temporal distribution of wildfire and timber harvesting. Existing forest planning models are not well suited to dealing with this uncertainty because they produce deterministic projections based on central tendencies of these drivers. Here we present a new approach for incorporating uncertainty into forest management planning, which we demonstrate using two landscapes in the Canadian boreal forest. Our approach takes the assumptions contained within the latest forest management plans for each of these landscapes, including parameterizations of their deterministic forest planning models, and converts these assumptions into equivalent parameterizations of a stochastic, spatially-explicit state-and-transition simulation model (STSM). We then use Monte Carlo simulations with the STSM to “stress-test” the forest management plan with respect to a range of possible future uncertainties, including uncertainties in future levels and patterns of wildfire and timber harvest, along with the possible changes in wildfire that might result from future climate change. Our analysis demonstrates the importance of incorporating stochastic variability into projections of future ecosystem condition. The STSM projections that acknowledged variability in wildfire and timber harvest differed from the deterministic forest planning model projections that were based solely on mean values. Our analysis also suggests that there is an increased risk of shortfalls in timber harvest, for both boreal landscapes, associated with future projections for changes in wildfire due to climate change, and that management strategies aimed at reducing the future level of timber harvest offer an opportunity to mitigate these risks. We believe our approach provides a new risk-based framework for incorporating uncertainty into forest management, including the effects of climate change.},

To assess forest impacts from climate change, the existing empirical information must be structured, harmonised and assimilated into a form suitable to develop and test state-of-the-art forest and ecosystem models. The combination of empirical data collected at large spatial and long temporal scales with suitable modelling approaches is key to understand forest dynamics under climate change. To facilitate data and model integration, we identified major climate change impacts observed on European forest functioning and summarised the data available for monitoring and predicting such impacts. Our analysis of c. 120 forest-related databases (including information from remote sensing, vegetation inventories, dendroecology, palaeoecology, eddy-flux sites, common garden experiments and genetic techniques) and 50 databases of environmental drivers highlights a substantial degree of data availability and accessibility. However, some critical variables relevant to predicting European forest responses to climate change are only available at relatively short time frames (up to 10-20 years), including intra-specific trait variability, defoliation patterns, tree mortality and recruitment. Moreover, we identified data gaps or lack of data integration particularly in variables related to local adaptation and phenotypic plasticity, dispersal capabilities and physiological responses. Overall, we conclude that forest data availability across Europe is improving, but further efforts are needed to integrate, harmonise and interpret this data (i.e. making data useable for non-experts). Continuation of existing monitoring and networks schemes together with the establishments of new networks to address data gaps is crucial to rigorously predict climate change impacts on European forests.},

abstract = {Current predictions on species responses to climate change strongly rely on projecting altered environmental conditions on species distributions. However, it is increasingly acknowledged that climate change also influences species interactions. We review and synthesize literature information on biotic interactions and use it to argue that the abundance of species and the direction of selection during climate change vary depending on how their trophic interactions become disrupted. Plant abundance can be controlled by aboveground and belowground multitrophic level interactions with herbivores, pathogens, symbionts and their enemies. We discuss how these interactions may alter during climate change and the resulting species range shifts. We suggest conceptual analogies between species responses to climate warming and exotic species introduced in new ranges. There are also important differences: the herbivores, pathogens and mutualistic symbionts of range-expanding species and their enemies may co-migrate, and the continuous gene flow under climate warming can make adaptation in the expansion zone of range expanders different from that of cross-continental exotic species. We conclude that under climate change, results of altered species interactions may vary, ranging from species becoming rare to disproportionately abundant. Taking these possibilities into account will provide a new perspective on predicting species distribution under climate change.},

abstract = {Species distribution models predict a wholesale redistribution of trees in the next century, yet migratory responses necessary to spatially track climates far exceed maximum post-glacial rates. The extent to which populations will adapt will depend upon phenotypic variation, strength of selection, fecundity, inter- specific competition, and biotic interactions. Populations of temperate and bor- eal trees show moderate to strong clines in phenology and growth along temperature gradients, indicating substantial local adaptation. Traits involved in local adaptation appear to be the product of small effects of many genes, and the resulting genotypic redundancy combined with high fecundity may facilitate rapid local adaptation despite high gene flow. Gene flow with pre- adapted alleles from warmer climates may promote adaptation and migration at the leading edge, while populations at the rear will likely face extirpation. Widespread species with large populations and high fecundity are likely to per- sist and adapt, but will likely suffer adaptational lag for a few generations.

abstract = {Summary 1 Eidothea hardeniana (Proteaceae) is a narrow endemic representative of an ancient lineage restricted to a single site in northern New South Wales (Australia). This study aims to identify the life-history traits most likely to have influenced the current distribution pattern of this rain forest tree. 2 Using ecological and molecular analyses we found that its range is limited by the absence of efficient dispersal mechanisms rather than by habitat availability, or as a result of a recent bottleneck or of reproductive failure. 3 Resprouts can take over the position of senesced plants, even in the absence of disturbance, allowing local persistence and the maintenance of genetic diversity. Long-term persistence and preferential outcrossing further favour relatively high levels of diversity (HE = 0.542) despite a small effective population size (Ne = 21.6). 4 We used eight life-history traits to assess if the E. hardeniana findings were valid across 258 local taxa. Current distribution patterns of rain forest species within a species-rich community were accounted for by linking two important components of community assembly theory: dispersal and niche assembly. 5 The interaction of the seed-based dispersal dimension and resprouting potential best explains the current distribution of rare local taxa. Major dimensions of life-history trait variation were identified among local plant species, suggesting that a range of interacting traits contribute to a species' response to environmental variables and mitigate the influence of potentially adverse circumstances. 6 The benefits of merging ecological and genetic approaches to interpret species distribution and population structure are applicable across a broader range of studies. Our findings highlight how currently constrained palaeo-endemic species with small populations in refugial habitats may retain the capacity to both persist and expand in response to changing circumstances and opportunities. This has important implications for species conservation, habitat management and reserve design},

abstract = {Large-scale synchronous variations in community dynamics are well documented for a vast array of organisms, but are considerably less understood for forest trees. Because of temporal variations in canopy gap dynamics, forest communities-even old-growth ones-are never at equilibrium at the stand scale. This paucity of equilibrium may also be true at the regional scale. Our objectives were to determine (1) if nonequilibrium dynamics caused by temporal variations in the formation of canopy gaps are regionally synchronized, and (2) if spatiotemporal variations in canopy gap formation affect the relative abundance of tree species in the understory. We examined these questions by analyzing variations in the suppression and release history of Acer saccharum Marsh. and Fagus grandifolia Ehrh. from 481 growth series of understory saplings taken from 34 mature stands. We observed that (1) the proportion of stems in release as a function of time exhibited a U-shaped pattern over the last 35 years, with the lowest levels occurring during 1975-1985, and that (2) the response to this in terms of species composition was that A. saccharum became more abundant at sites that had the highest proportion of stems in release during 1975-1985. We concluded that the understory dynamics, typically thought of as a stand-scale process, may be regionally synchronized.},

abstract = {Accounting for water stress-induced tree mortality in forest productivity models remains a challenge due to uncertainty in stress tolerance of tree populations. In this study, logistic regression models were developed to assess species-specific relationships between probability of mortality (Pm) and drought, drawing on 8.1 million observations of change in vital status (m) of individual trees across North America. Drought was defined by standardized (relative) values of soil water content (Ws,z) and reference evapotranspiration (ETr,z) at each field plot. The models additionally tested for interactions between the water-balance variables, aridity class of the site (AC), and estimated tree height (h). Considering drought improved model performance in 95 (80) per cent of the 64 tested species during calibration (cross-validation). On average, sensitivity to relative drought increased with site AC (i.e. aridity). Interaction between water-balance variables and estimated tree height indicated that drought sensitivity commonly decreased during early height development and increased during late height development, which may reflect expansion of the root system and decreasing whole-plant, leaf-specific hydraulic conductance, respectively. Across North America, predictions suggested that changes in the water balance caused mortality to increase from 1.1{\%} yr−1 in 1951 to 2.0{\%} yr−1 in 2014 (a net change of 0.9 ± 0.3{\%} yr−1). Interannual variation in mortality also increased, driven by increasingly severe droughts in 1988, 1998, 2006, 2007 and 2012. With strong confidence, this study indicates that water stress is a common cause of tree mortality. With weak-to-moderate confidence, this study strengthens previous claims attributing positive trends in mortality to increasing levels of water stress. This ‘learn-as-we-go' approach – defined by sampling rare drought events as they continue to intensify – will help to constrain the hydraulic limits of dominant tree species and the viability of boreal and temperate forest biomes under continued climate change.},

abstract = {Aim: Our understanding of the mechanisms that maintain forest diversity under changing climate can benefit from knowledge about traits that are closely linked to fitness. We tested whether the link between traits and seed number and seed size is consistent with two hypotheses, termed the leaf economics spectrum and the plant size syndrome, or whether reproduction represents an independent dimension related to a seed size–seed number trade-off. Location: Most of the data come from Europe, North and Central America and East Asia. A minority of the data come from South America, Africa and Australia. Time period: 1960–2022. Major taxa studied: Trees. Methods: We gathered 12 million observations of the number of seeds produced in 784 tree species. We estimated the number of seeds produced by individual trees and scaled it up to the species level. Next, we used principal components analysis and generalized joint attribute modelling (GJAM) to map seed number and size on the tree traits spectrum. Results: Incorporating seed size and number into trait analysis while controlling for environment and phylogeny with GJAM exposes relationships in trees that might otherwise remain hidden. Production of the large total biomass of seeds [product of seed number and seed size; hereafter, species seed productivity (SSP)] is associated with high leaf area, low foliar nitrogen, low specific leaf area (SLA) and dense wood. Production of high seed numbers is associated with small seeds produced by nutrient-demanding species with softwood, small leaves and high SLA. Trait covariation is consistent with opposing strategies: one fast-growing, early successional, with high dispersal, and the other slow-growing, stress-tolerant, that recruit in shaded conditions. Main conclusions: Earth system models currently assume that reproductive allocation is indifferent among plant functional types. Easily measurable seed size is a strong predictor of the seed number and species seed productivity. The connection of SSP with the functional traits can form the first basis of improved fecundity prediction across global forests.},

One critical, albeit often ignored, limitation of these area-based estimates is their disregard of the ecological context that shapes species distributions. In this study, we estimate species loss using a spatially explicit mechanistic simulation model to evaluate three important aspects of ecological context: coexistence mechanisms (e.g. species sorting, competition–colonization tradeoffs and neutral dynamics), spatial distribution of environmental conditions, and spatial pattern of habitat loss. We found that 1) area-based estimates of extinctions are sensitive to coexistence mechanisms as well as to the pattern of environmental heterogeneity; 2) there is a strong interaction between coexistence mechanisms and the pattern of habitat loss; 3) SARs always yield higher estimates of species loss than do EARs; and 4) SARs and EARs consistently underestimate the realized species loss. Our results highlight the need to integrate ecological mechanisms in area-estimates of species loss. Species},

abstract = {There is currently an increasing societal and political shift towards more sustainable agricultural systems to provide both food production and ecological biodiversity levels. This shift has recently modified scientific questioning and brought up new research challenges for agro-ecological research. This is the case in particular for weed management, where issues have so far largely focused on the conflict between weeds and crop productivity. Here, we review recent findings that have led to a changing perception on weeds in agro-ecosystems and upcoming areas in terms of weed management options. Our main findings are that weeds have numerous interactions with other organisms and, in turn, some of these interactions can have direct, either negative or positive, effects on the functioning of the agro-ecosystem. Many interactions are species-specific, and therefore assessing the role of weed communities in the agro-ecosystem would benefit from further development in the functional grouping of weed species. In terms of weed management our review shows that alternative cropping systems can deliver both good levels of crop productivity and of weed management at the field level. Weeds respond to landscape attributes and there is a need to fully assess the scope for utilizing the spatio-temporal organization of cropping systems and uncultivated habitats as a tool for minimizing weed infestations. Weeds are also submitted to biological regulation through the predation of their seeds and further research is required to assess the effect of cropping systems and landscape on levels of weed natural enemies, and therefore on the potential contribution of biological regulation in the management of weeds.},

abstract = {The majority of research on biodiversity-ecosystem functioning in laboratories has concentrated on a few traits, but there is increasing evidence from the field that functional diversity controls ecosystem functioning more often than does species number. Given the importance of traits as predictors of niche complementarity and community structures, we (1) examine how the diversity sensu lato of forest trees, freshwater fishes and soil invertebrates might support ecosystem functioning and (2) discuss the relevance of productive biota for monophyletic assemblages (taxocenes).In terrestrial ecosystems, correlating traits to abiotic factors is complicated by the appropriate choice of body-size distributions. Angiosperm and gymnosperm trees, for example, show metabolic incongruences in their respiration rates despite their pronounced macroecological scaling. Scaling heterotrophic organisms within their monophyletic assemblages seems more difficult than scaling autotrophs: in contrast to the generally observed decline of mass-specific metabolic rates with body mass within metazoans, soil organisms such as protozoans show opposite mass-specific trends.At the community level, the resource demand of metazoans shapes multitrophic interactions. Hence, population densities and their food web relationships reflect functional diversity, but the influence of biodiversity on stability and ecosystem functioning remains less clear. We focused on fishes in 18 riverine food webs, where the ratio of primary versus secondary extinctions (hereafter, 'extinction partitioning') summarizes the responses of fish communities to primary species loss (deletions) and its consequences. Based on extinction partitioning, our high-diversity food webs were just as (or even more) vulnerable to extinctions as low-diversity food webs.Our analysis allows us to assess consequences of the relocation or removal of fish species and to help with decision-making in sustainable river management. The study highlights that the topology of food webs (and not simply taxonomic diversity) plays a greater role in stabilizing the food web and enhancing ecological services than is currently acknowledged. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

We show how model construction can exploit the close correspondence between stochastic IPMs and statistical analysis of trait–fate relationships in a “mixed” or “hierarchical” models framework.

abstract = {The topics of succession and post-disturbance ecosystem recovery have a long and convoluted history. There is extensive redundancy within this body of theory, which has resulted in confusion, and the links among theories have not been adequately drawn. This review aims to distil the unique ideas from the array of theory related to ecosystem change in response to disturbance. This will help to reduce redundancy, and improve communication and understanding between researchers. We first outline the broad range of concepts that have developed over the past century to describe community change in response to disturbance. The body of work spans overlapping succession concepts presented by Clements in 1916, Egler in 1954, and Connell and Slatyer in 1977. Other theories describing community change include state and transition models, biological legacy theory, and the application of functional traits to predict responses to disturbance. Second, we identify areas of overlap of these theories, in addition to highlighting the conceptual and taxonomic limitations of each. In aligning each of these theories with one another, the limited scope and relative inflexibility of some theories becomes apparent, and redundancy becomes explicit. We identify a set of unique concepts to describe the range of mechanisms driving ecosystem responses to disturbance. We present a schematic model of our proposed synthesis which brings together the range of unique mechanisms that were identified in our review. The model describes five main mechanisms of transition away from a post-disturbance community: (i) pulse events with rapid state shifts; (ii) stochastic community drift; (iii) facilitation; (iv) competition; and (v) the influence of the initial composition of a post-disturbance community. In addition, stabilising processes such as biological legacies, inhibition or continuing disturbance may prevent a transition between community types. Integrating these six mechanisms with the functional trait approach is likely to improve the predictive capacity of disturbance theory. Finally, we complement our discussion of theory with a case study which emphasises that many post-disturbance theories apply simultaneously to the same ecosystem. Using the well-studied mountain ash (Eucalyptus regnans) forests of south-eastern Australia, we illustrate phenomena that align with six of the theories described in our model of rationalised disturbance theory. We encourage further work to improve our schematic model, increase coverage of disturbance-related theory, and to show how the model may link to, or integrate with, other domains of ecological theory.},

A key advantage of IBMs is that the basis for predictions-fitness maximization by individual organisms-is more general and reliable than the empirical relationships that other models depend on. Case studies illustrate the usefulness and predictive success of long-term IBE programs. The pioneering programs had three phases: conceptualization, implementation, and diversification. Continued validation of models runs throughout these phases. The breakthroughs that make IBE more productive include standards for describing and validating IBMs, improved and standardized theory for individual traits and behavior, software tools, and generalized instead of system-specific IBMs. We provide guidelines for pursuing IBE and a vision for future IBE research.},

Methods: Commercial D-dimer assays, evaluated according to predetermined cutoff levels for each assay, specific for age (lower in subjects {\textless}70 years) and gender (lower in males), were used in the recent DULCIS study. The present analysis compared the results obtained in the DULCIS with those that might have been had using the following different cutoff criteria: traditional cutoff for VTE exclusion, higher levels in subjects aged ≥60 years, or age multiplied by 10. Results: In young subjects, the DULCIS low cutoff levels resulted in half the recurrent events that would have occurred using the other criteria. In elderly patients, the DULCIS results were similar to those calculated for the two age-adjusted criteria. The adoption of traditional VTE exclusion criteria would have led to positive results in the large majority of elderly subjects, without a significant reduction in the rate of recurrent event. Conclusion: The results confirm the usefulness of the cutoff levels used in DULCIS.},

abstract = {1. The boreal biome, representing approximately one-third of remaining global forests, pro-vides a number of crucial ecosystem services. A particular challenge in forest ecosystems is to reconcile demand for an increased timber production with provisioning of other ecosystem services and biodiversity. However, there is still little knowledge about how forest manage-ment could help solve this challenge. Hence, studies that investigate how to manage forests to reduce trade-offs between ecosystem services and biodiversity are urgently needed to help forest owners and policy makers take informed decisions. 2. We applied seven alternative forest management regimes using a forest growth simulator in a large boreal forest production landscape. First, we estimated the potential of the land-scape to provide harvest revenues, store carbon and maintain biodiversity across a 50-year time period. Then, we applied multiobjective optimization to identify the trade-offs between these three objectives and to identify the optimal combination of forest management regimes to achieve these objectives. 3. It was not possible to achieve high levels of either carbon storage or biodiversity if the objec-tive of forest management was to maximize timber harvest revenues. Moreover, conflicts between biodiversity and carbon storage became stronger when simultaneously targeting high levels of timber revenues. However, with small reductions in timber revenues, it was possible to greatly increase the multifunctionality of the landscape, especially the biodiversity indicators. 4. Forest management actions, alternative to business-as-usual management, such as reducing thinnings, extending the rotation period and increasing the amount of area set aside from forestry may be necessary to safeguard biodiversity and non-timber ecosystem services in Fennoscandia. 5. Synthesis and applications. Our results show that no forest management regime alone is able to maximize timber revenues, carbon storage and biodiversity individually or simultane-ously and that a combination of different regimes is needed to resolve the conflicts among these objectives. We conclude that it is possible to reduce the trade-offs between different objectives by applying diversified forest management planning at the boreal landscape level and that we need to give up the all-encompassing objective of very intensive timber production, which is prevailing particularly in Fennoscandian countries.},

Here we review the anthropogenic drivers of defaunation, provide a brief historical account of the development of this field, and analyze the types of biological consequences of this impact on the structure and functioning of tropical ecosystems. We identify how defaunation, operating at a variety of scales, from the plot to the global level, affects biological systems along a gradient of processes ranging from plant physiology (vegetative and reproductive performance) and animal behavior (movement, foraging and dietary patterns) in the immediate term; to plant population and community dynamics and structure leading to disruptions of ecosystem functioning (and thus degrading environmental services) in the short to medium term; to evolutionary changes (phenotypic changes and population genetic structure) in the long-term. We present such a synthesis as a preamble to a series of papers that provide a compilation of our current understanding of the impact and consequences of tropical defaunation. We close by identifying some of the most urgent needs and perspectives that warrant further study to improve our understanding of this field, as we confront the challenges of living in a defaunated world.},

abstract = {Environmental fluctuations are pervasive in nature, but the influence of nondirectional temporal variation on range limits has received scant attention. We synthesize insights from the literature and use simple models to make conceptual points about the potentially wide range of ecological and evolutionary effects of temporal variation on range limits. Because organisms respond nonlinearly to environmental conditions, temporal variation can directionally alter long-Term growth rates, either to shrink or to expand ranges. We illustrate this diversity of outcomes with a model of competition along a mortality gradient. Temporal variation can permit transitions between alternative states, potentially facilitating range expansion. We show this for variation in dispersal, using simple source sink population models (with strong Allee effects, or with gene flow hampering local adaptation). Temporal variation enhances extinction risk owing to demographic stochasticity, rare events, and loss of genetic variation, all tending to shrink ranges. However, specific adaptations to exploit variation (including dispersal) may permit larger ranges than in similar but constant environments. Grappling with temporal variation is essential both to understand eco-evolutionary dynamics at range limits and to guide conservation and management strategies.},

Game theory provides a mathematical language for understanding evolution by natural selection. Continuous-trait game theory starts with the notion of an evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) and adds the concept of convergence stability (that the ESS is an evolutionary attractor). With these basic tools in hand, continuous-trait game theory can be easily extended to model evolution under conditions of disruptive selection and speciation, nonequilibrium population dynamics, stochastic environments, coevolution, and more. Many models applying these tools to evolutionary ecology and coevolution have been developed in the past two decades. Going forward we emphasize the communication of the conceptual simplicity and underlying unity of ideas inherent in continuous-trait game theory and the development of new applications to biological questions.},

A greening of the boreal landscape has been observed using remote sensing, and the seasonal amplitude of CO2 in the northern hemisphere has increased, indicating warming effects on ecosystem productivity. However, field observations on responses of ecosystem productivity have been lacking on a large sub-biome scale. Here we report a significant increase in the annual growth of boreal forests in Finland in response to climatic warming, especially since 1990. This finding is obtained by linking meteorological records and forest inventory data on an area between 60° and 70° northern latitude. An additional increase in growth has occurred in response to changes in other drivers, such as forest management, nitrogen deposition and/or CO2 concentration. A similar warming impact can be expected in the entire boreal zone, where warming takes place. Given the large size of the boreal biome - more than ten million km2- important climate feedbacks are at stake, such as the future carbon balance, transpiration and albedo.},

abstract = {Obtaining reliable predictions of species range shifts under climate change is a crucial challenge for ecologists and stakeholders. At the continental scale, niche-based models have been widely used in the last 10 years to predict the potential impacts of climate change on species distributions all over the world, although these models do not include any mechanistic relationships. In contrast, species-specific, process-based predictions remain scarce at the continental scale. This is regrettable because to secure relevant and accurate predictions it is always desirable to compare predictions derived from different kinds of models applied independently to the same set of species and using the same raw data. Here we compare predictions of range shifts under climate change scenarios for 2100 derived from niche-based models with those of a process-based model for 15 North American boreal and temperate tree species. A general pattern emerged from our comparisons: niche-based models tend to predict a stronger level of extinction and a greater proportion of colonization than the process-based model. This result likely arises because niche-based models do not take phenotypic plasticity and local adaptation into account. Nevertheless, as the two kinds of models rely on different assumptions, their complementarity is revealed by common findings. Both modeling approaches highlight a major potential limitation on species tracking their climatic niche because of migration constraints and identify similar zones where species extirpation is likely. Such convergent predictions from models built on very different principles provide a useful way to offset uncertainties at the continental scale. This study shows that the use in concert of both approaches with their own caveats and advantages is crucial to obtain more robust results and that comparisons among models are needed in the near future to gain accuracy regarding predictions of range shifts under climate change.},

abstract = {Weeds are a major threat to biodiversity including in areas of high conservation value. Unfortunately, people may be unintentionally introducing and dispersing weed seeds on their clothing when they visit these areas. To inform the management of these areas, we conducted a systematic quantitative literature review to determine the diversity and characteristics of species with seeds that can attach and be dispersed from clothing. Across 21 studies identified from systematic literature searches on this topic, seeds from 449 species have been recorded on clothing, more than double the diversity found in a previous review. Nearly all of them, 391 species, are listed weeds in one or more countries, with 58 classified as internationally-recognised environmental weeds. When our database was compared with weed lists from different countries and continents we found that clothing can carry the seeds of important regional weeds. A total of 287 of the species are listed as aliens in one or more countries in Europe, 156 are invasive species/noxious weeds in North America, 211 are naturalized alien plants in Australia, 97 are alien species in India, 33 are invasive species in China and 5 are declared weeds/invaders in South Africa. Seeds on the clothing of hikers can be carried to an average distance of 13km, and where people travel in cars, trains, planes and boats, the seeds on their clothing can be carried much further. Factors that affect this type of seed dispersal include the type of clothing, the type of material the clothing is made from, the number and location of the seeds on plants, and seed traits such as adhesive and attachment structures. With increasing use of protected areas by tourists, including in remote regions, popular protected areas may be at great risk of biological invasions by weeds with seeds carried on clothing. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Ecosystems and ecosystem services are subjected to both typical disturbances (e.g., fire) and shifting climatic baselines resulting from anthropogenic drivers. Recovery from these perturbations is of prime interest to researchers and land managers. We explore how differing regeneration of the coniferous forest to specific disturbances and a shifting climate are mediated through managerial responses, in terms of both species composition and an important ecosystem service, carbon sequestration in the southern Rocky Mountains, Colorado, USA. 112 sites across a variety of disturbance histories were surveyed for post-fire regeneration; carbon stock growth was then simulated in the US Forest Service Forest Vegetation Simulator under a variety of climate change scenarios for 100. years. Simultaneously, we simulated three managerial responses to the disturbance: no action, planting of local species (resilience-oriented management), and planting of the most climatically suitable species (adaptation-oriented management). These managerial responses simulate varying levels of intervention which attempt to maintain forest properties and associated carbon stocks. Carbon stocks, initially, were more resilient than the coniferous forest system; areas with little coniferous regeneration recovered carbon at a similar pace due to an influx of deciduous seedlings. However, future climate exerts a strong influence on carbon stocks. Both the no-action scenario and the resilience-oriented management scenario transitioned to non-forest by the end of the simulation period, due to climatic changes. Active, adaptation-oriented management, which included establishment of non-local species, maintained forest structure and carbon stocks under most future climate projections, albeit at lower densities. So while this preserves the presence of a forest, it does not preserve the presence of a specific forest. However, for ecosystem services associated with the mere existence of forest cover (e.g., carbon stocks and general forest habitat), this may be sufficient. In a sense, disturbances are opportunities for more climatically-adapted species/communities to establish, although the complexities of assisted migration and novel ecosystems remain. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Seed from poor-quality edge habitat (one of two transects) had inferior emergence, but edge seeds also had adaptive phenology (both transects). High-elevation plants flowered earlier, required less heat accumulation to mature seed, and so achieved higher lifetime fitness at and above the range edge. Experimental warming improved fitness above the range, but eliminated the advantage of local cold-edge populations, supporting recent models in which cold-adapted edge populations do not facilitate warming-induced range shifts. The highest above-range fitness was achieved by a ‘super edge phenotype' from a neighbouring mountain, suggesting key adaptations exist regionally even if absent from local edge populations.},

abstract = {People depend on benefits provided by ecological systems. Understanding how these ecosystem services - and the ecosystem properties underpinning them - respond to drivers of change is therefore an urgent priority. We address this challenge through developing a novel risk-assessment framework that integrates ecological and evolutionary perspectives on functional traits to determine species' effects on ecosystems and their tolerance of environmental changes. We define Specific Effect Function (SEF) as the per-gram or per capita capacity of a species to affect an ecosystem property, and Specific Response Function (SRF) as the ability of a species to maintain or enhance its population as the environment changes. Our risk assessment is based on the idea that the security of ecosystem services depends on how effects (SEFs) and tolerances (SRFs) of organisms - which both depend on combinations of functional traits - correlate across species and how they are arranged on the species' phylogeny. Four extreme situations are theoretically possible, from minimum concern when SEF and SRF are neither correlated nor show a phylogenetic signal, to maximum concern when they are negatively correlated (i.e., the most important species are the least tolerant) and phylogenetically patterned (lacking independent backup). We illustrate the assessment with five case studies, involving both plant and animal examples. However, the extent to which the frequency of the four plausible outcomes, or their intermediates, apply more widely in real-world ecological systems is an open question that needs empirical evidence, and suggests a research agenda at the interface of evolutionary biology and ecosystem ecology.},

abstract = {Models of the geographic distributions of species have wide application in ecology. But the nonspatial, single-level, regression models that ecologists have often employed do not deal with problems of irregular sampling intensity or spatial dependence, and do not adequately quantify uncertainty. We show here how to build statistical models that can handle these features of spatial prediction and provide richer, more powerful inference about species niche relations, distributions, and the effects of human disturbance. We begin with a familiar generalized linear model and build in additional features, including spatial random effects and hierarchical levels. Since these models are fully specified statistical models, we show that it is possible to add complexity without sacrificing interpretability. This step-by-step approach, together with attached code that implements a simple, spatially explicit, regression model, is structured to facilitate self-teaching. All models are developed in a Bayesian framework. We assess the performance of the models by using them to predict the distributions of two plant species (Proteaceae) from South Africa's Cape Floristic Region. We demonstrate that making distribution models spatially explicit can be essential for accurately characterizing the environmental response of species, predicting their probability of occurrence, and assessing uncertainty in the model results. Adding hierarchical levels to the models has further advantages in allowing human transformation of the landscape to be taken into account, as well as additional features of the sampling process.},

abstract = {Species distribution models predict a wholesale redistribution of trees in the next century, yet migratory responses necessary to spatially track climates far exceed maximum post-glacial rates. The extent to which populations will adapt will depend upon phenotypic variation, strength of selection, fecundity, interspecific competition, and biotic interactions. Populations of temperate and boreal trees show moderate to strong clines in phenology and growth along temperature gradients, indicating substantial local adaptation. Traits involved in local adaptation appear to be the product of small effects of many genes, and the resulting genotypic redundancy combined with high fecundity may facilitate rapid local adaptation despite high gene flow. Gene flow with preadapted alleles from warmer climates may promote adaptation and migration at the leading edge, while populations at the rear will likely face extirpation. Widespread species with large populations and high fecundity are likely to persist and adapt, but will likely suffer adaptational lag for a few generations. As all tree species will be suffering lags, interspecific competition may weaken, facilitating persistence under suboptimal conditions. Species with small populations, fragmented ranges, low fecundity, or suffering declines due to introduced insects or diseases should be candidates for facilitated migration.},

Location: Araucaria forest and Campos grassland mosaic in southern Brazilian highlands (2929S, 5012W). Methods: We collected data on the density of forest woody species in plots located on rocky outcrops and in open fields subject to different management regimes. We evaluated the influence of outcrops on the density of forest plants 60-cm tall, and the effects of other environmental variables and of site on plant density; we also used information on diaspore traits of the species to discuss the way in which plants disperse to the outcrops. Results: Rocky outcrops harbored a significantly higher density of forest plants than open fields, irrespective of site effect, and rock height was the best predictor for plant density on outcrops. Diaspores of all recorded species possess characteristics associated with dispersal by birds or mammals or by both. Conclusions: Small rocky outcrops markedly influence forest expansion by acting as perches for vertebrate dispersers and as nurse objects and safe sites for plants. Forest expansion starting in small outcrops possibly occurs as follows: perching of dispersers and increase of seed rain on rocks, promotion of better conditions of establishment for forest plants by nurse rocks, protection of plants sensitive to grazing and fire, and nucleation of forest vegetation.},

abstract = {Context Forest landscapes at the boreal-temperate ecotone have been extensively altered. Reducing the gap between current and presettlement forest conditions through ecosystem-based forest management (EBFM) is thought to enhance ecological integrity. However, climate change may interfere with this goal and make these targets unrealistic. Objectives We evaluated the impacts of climate change on the ability of EBFM to reduce discrepancies between current and presettlement forest conditions in southeastern Canada. Methods We used early-land-survey data as well as projections from a forest landscape model (LANDIS-II) under four climate change scenarios and four management scenarios to evaluate future discrepancies between presettlement forest conditions and future forest landscapes. Results By triggering swift declines in most late-succession boreal conifer species biomass, climate change would greatly reduce the ability of forest management to reduce the gap with presettlement forest composition, especially under severe anthro-pogenic climate forcing. Scenarios assuming Electronic supplementary material The online version of this article (https://doi.org/10.1007/s10980-018-0761-6) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.

Conclusions EBFM would still be the ''less bad'' forest harvesting strategy in order to mitigate composition discrepancies with the presettlement forests, though it is likely to fail under severe climate forcing. In this latter case, one might thus question the relevancy of using presettlement forest composition as a target for restoring degraded forest landscapes. As such, we advocate that managers should relax the centrality of the reference condition and focus on functional restoration rather than aiming at reducing the gaps with presettlement forest composition per se.},

abstract = {We add an ecosystem perspective to spatially structured communities subject to colonization-extinction dynamics. We derive a plant-based metaecosystem model to analyze how the spatial flows of the biotic and abiotic forms of a limiting nutrient affect persistence and coexistence. We show that the proportion of patches supporting plants in a region has a considerable impact on local nutrient dynamics. Then we explicitly couple nutrient dynamics to patch dynamics. Our model shows strong feedback between local and regional dynamics mediated by nutrient flows. We find that nutrient flows can have either positive or negative effects on species persistence and coexistence. The essential feature of this local-regional coupling is the net direction of the nutrient flows between occupied and empty patches. A net flow of nutrients from occupied to empty patches leads to indirect facilitative interactions, such as an inferior competitor promoting the persistence of a superior competitor. We show that nutrient flows affect the potential diversity of the metaecosystem and key features of plant community dynamics, such as the shape of the competition-colonization trade-off and successional sequences. Our analysis revealed that integrating ecosystem and spatial dynamics can lead to various indirect interactions that contribute significantly to community organization.},

abstract = {The highly distinctive and mostly endemic Australian land mammal fauna has suffered an extraordinary rate of extinction ({\textgreater}10{\%} of the 273 endemic terrestrial species) over the last ∼200 y: in comparison, only one native land mammal from continental North America became extinct since European settlement. A further 21{\%} of Australian endemic land mammal species are now assessed to be threatened, indicating that the rate of loss (of one to two extinctions per decade) is likely to continue. Australia's marine mammals have fared better overall, but status assessment for them is seriously impeded by lack of information. Much of the loss of Australian land mammal fauna (particularly in the vast deserts and tropical savannas) has been in areas that are remote from human population centers and recognized as relatively unmodified at global scale. In contrast to general patterns of extinction on other continents where the main cause is habitat loss, hunting, and impacts of human development, particularly in areas of high and increasing human population pressures, the loss of Australian land mammals is most likely due primarily to predation by introduced species, particularly the feral cat, Felis catus, and European red fox, Vulpes vulpes, and changed fire regimes.},

abstract = {Environmental heterogeneity is regarded as one of the most important factors governing species richness gradients. An increase in available niche space, provision of refuges and opportunities for isolation and divergent adaptation are thought to enhance species coexistence, persistence and diversification. However, the extent and generality of positive heterogeneity–richness relationships are still debated. Apart from widespread evidence supporting positive relationships, negative and hump-shaped relationships have also been reported. In a meta-analysis of 1148 data points from 192 studies worldwide, we examine the strength and direction of the relationship between spatial environmental heterogeneity and species richness of terrestrial plants and animals. We find that separate effects of heterogeneity in land cover, vegetation, climate, soil and topography are significantly positive, with vegetation and topographic heterogeneity showing particularly strong associations with species richness. The use of equal-area study units, spatial grain and spatial extent emerge as key factors influencing the strength of heterogeneity–richness relationships, highlighting the pervasive influence of spatial scale in heterogeneity–richness studies. We provide the first quantitative support for the generality of positive heterogeneity–richness relationships across heterogeneity components, habitat types, taxa and spatial scales from landscape to global extents, and identify specific needs for future comparative heterogeneity–richness research.},

abstract = {Effects of genetically modified herbicide-tolerant (GMHT) and conventional crop management on invertebrate trophic groups (herbivores, detritivores, pollinators, predators and parasitoids) were compared in beet, maize and spring oilseed rape sites throughout the UK. These trophic groups were influenced by season, crop species and GMHT management. Many groups increased twofold to fivefold in abundance between early and late summer, and differed up to 10-fold between crop species. GMHT management superimposed relatively small (less than twofold), but consistent, shifts in plant and insect abundance, the extent and direction of these effects being dependent on the relative efficacies of comparable conventional herbicide regimes. In general, the biomass of weeds was reduced under GMHT management in beet and spring oilseed rape and increased in maize compared with conventional treatments. This change in resource availability had knock-on effects on higher trophic levels except in spring oilseed rape where herbivore resource was greatest. Herbivores, pollinators and natural enemies changed in abundance in the same directions as their resources, and detritivores increased in abundance under GMHT management across all crops. The result of the later herbicide application in GMHT treatments was a shift in resource from the herbivore food web to the detritivore food web. The Farm Scale Evaluations have demonstrated over 3 years and throughout the UK that herbivores, detritivores and many of their predators and parasitoids in arable systems are sensitive to the changes in weed communities that result from the introduction of new herbicide regimes.},

abstract = {Pollen flow is a key biological process that connects plant populations, preventing genetic impoverishment and inbreeding. Pollen-mediated long-distance dispersal (LDD) events are especially important for plant species in increasingly fragmented landscapes. Patterns of pollen dispersal were directly estimated and dispersal kernels modelled in an experimental population of Ranunculus bulbosus and Trifolium montanum to determine the potential for LDD. Eight and 11 microsatellite markers were used for R. bulbosus and T. montanum, respectively, to run a likelihood-based paternity analysis on randomly chosen offspring (Ntotal=180 per species) from five maternal plants. High rates of selfing were found in R. bulbosus (average 45.7{\%}), while no selfing was observed in T. montanum. The majority (60{\%}) of mating events occurred at very short distances: the median of the observed dispersal distances was 0.8m in both species, and the average distances were 15.9 and 10.3m in R. bulbosus and T. montanum, respectively. Modelling the pollen dispersal kernel with four different distribution functions (exponential-power, geometric, 2Dt and Weibull) indicated that the best fit for both species was given by a Weibull function. Yet, the tail of the T. montanum pollen dispersal kernel was thinner than in R. bulbosus, suggesting that the probability for LDD is higher in the latter species. Even though the majority of pollen dispersal occurred across short distances, the detection of several mating events up to 362m (R. bulbosus) and 324m (T. montanum) suggests that pollen flow may be sufficient to ensure population connectivity in these herb species across fragmented grasslands in Swiss agricultural landscapes. {\textcopyright} 2012 German Botanical Society and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands.},

Gene flow should be reduced in the site where the spider monkey is absent, and there should be a corresponding subpopulation differentiation of seed- lings within the spatial range of the movements of these primates in the absence of between-site differences in allelic frequencies. At the microhabitat (family) scale, seedlings growing under parent plants should be geneti- cally more related in the absence of the spider monkey than in its presence. Subpopulation differentiation was smaller where the spider monkey was present (four loci, F ST ? 0.011) than where it was absent (four loci, F ST ? 0.053) for the first year of study, but not for the second year (three loci, F ST ? 0.005 vs. 0.003). The number of al- leles in common among seedlings growing under parent plants was smaller in the presence of the spider mon- key than in its absence, showing family genetic structure in the first generation for both years of study (Mann- Whitney, z ? ? 2.17, p ? 0.03 and z ? ? 2.72, p ? 0.006 for 1996 and 1997, respectively). This family genetic structure in the first generation should accelerate the development of population genetic structure. Development of genetic structure might result in demographic changes, one of which would be a fitness reduction if the species were self-incompatible, as suggested for Inga by available evidence. Large birds and mammals are the main targets of subsistence hunting in the Neotropics. Extinction of seed-dispersing frugivores may result in pronounced changes in the demographic and genetic structure of trre species in Neotropical forests.},

abstract = {1. Climate change impacts on habitat suitability and demography are often studied, but direct$\backslash$r$\backslash$neffects on plant dispersal are rarely considered. To address this we analysed climate model projections$\backslash$r$\backslash$nof future wind speeds and modelled their possible impacts on dispersal and spread of winddispersed$\backslash$r$\backslash$nplants.$\backslash$r$\backslash$n2. Projections for 17 Global Climate Models and three emission scenarios suggested great uncertainty$\backslash$r$\backslash$nabout wind speeds in southern England by the period 2070–99. Projections ranged from$\backslash$r$\backslash$n)90{\%} to +100{\%} change in the mean wind speed, although the average projection was for large$\backslash$r$\backslash$nfalls in both summer and winter wind speeds.$\backslash$r$\backslash$n3. Using a novel method for converting projected changes in mean wind speed to new seasonal$\backslash$r$\backslash$nwind speed distributions, we parameterized a mechanistic model of seed dispersal by wind using$\backslash$r$\backslash$nbaseline and changes in mean wind speed from )80{\%}to+80{\%}.$\backslash$r$\backslash$n4. The mechanistic seed dispersal model was combined with demographic data in an analytical$\backslash$r$\backslash$nmodel of plant spread. This was carried out for three British native and three non-native species,$\backslash$r$\backslash$nwhich represented a range of life-forms.$\backslash$r$\backslash$n5. Dispersal kernels and population spread rates were affected disproportionately by changes in$\backslash$r$\backslash$nwind speed, demonstrating nonlinear propagation of uncertainty in wind speed projections through$\backslash$r$\backslash$nto modelled plant spread rates.$\backslash$r$\backslash$n6. Sensitivity analyses showed differences among the plant species in which demographic transitions$\backslash$r$\backslash$nwere most important in determining spread rates. By contrast, sensitivity of spread rates to dispersal$\backslash$r$\backslash$nparameters showed great consistency among species, with seed release height being more$\backslash$r$\backslash$nimportant than seed terminal velocity.$\backslash$r$\backslash$n7. Synthesis. Plant populations will need to shift their geographic ranges to keep pace with climate$\backslash$r$\backslash$nchange-driven habitat loss. This study shows that climate change may affect that ability by decreasing$\backslash$r$\backslash$nthe dispersal distances of wind-dispersed plants and thus their potential spread rates. However,$\backslash$r$\backslash$nthe modelling approach presented here illustrates that uncertainty in climate models leads to an$\backslash$r$\backslash$neven greater uncertainty about how dispersal and spread will change in future climates. Caution$\backslash$r$\backslash$nshould therefore be exercised in making predictions as to how fast plant species may spread in$\backslash$r$\backslash$nresponse to climate change.},

We encourage flexible approaches that promote reversible and incremental steps, and that favor ongoing learning and capacity to modify direction as situations change. We suggest that no single solution fits all future challenges, especially in the context of changing climates, and that the best strategy is to mix different approaches for different situations. Resources managers will be challenged to integrate adaptation strategies (actions that help ecosystems accommodate changes adaptively) and mitigation strategies (actions that enable ecosystems to reduce anthropogenic influences on global climate) into overall plans. Adaptive strategies include resistance options (forestall impacts and protect highly valued resources), resilience options (improve the capacity of ecosystems to return to desired conditions after disturbance), and response options (facilitate transition of ecosystems from current to new conditions). Mitigation strategies include options to sequester carbon and reduce overall greenhouse gas emissions. Priority-setting approaches (e.g., triage), appropriate for rapidly changing conditions and for situations where needs are greater than available capacity to respond, will become increasingly important in the future},

abstract = {The majority, if not all, species have a limited geographic range bounded by a distribution edge. Violent ecotones such as sea coasts clearly produce edges for many species; however such ecotones, while sufficient for the formation of an edge, are not always necessary. We demonstrate this by simulation in discrete time of a spatially structured finite size metapopulation subjected to a spatial gradient in per-unit-time population extinction probability together with spatially structured dispersal and recolonisation. We find that relatively sharp edges separating a homeland or main geographical range from an outland or zone of relatively sparse and ephemeral colonisation can form in gradual environmental gradients. The form and placing of the edge is an emergent property of the metapopulation dynamics. The sharpness of the edge declines with increasing dispersal distance, and is dependent on the relative scales of dispersal distance and gradient length. The space over which the edge develops is short relative to the potential species range. The edge is robust against changes in both the shape of the environmental gradient and to a lesser extent to alterations in the kind of dispersal operating. Persistence times in the absence of environmental gradients are virtually independent of the shape of the dispersal function describing migration. The common finding of bell shaped population density distributions across geographic ranges may occur without the strict necessity of a niche mediated response to a spatially autocorrelated environment.},

abstract = {One of the most promising recent advances in biogeography has been the increased interest and understanding of species distribution models – estimates of the probability that a species is present given environmental data. Unfortunately, such analyses ignore many aspects of ecology, and so are difficult to interpret. In particular, we know that species interactions have a profound influence on distributions, but it is not usually possible to incorporate this knowledge into species distribution models. What is needed is a rigorous understanding of how unmeasured biotic interactions affect the inferences generated by species distribution models. To fill this gap, we develop a general mathematical approach that uses probability theory to determine how unmeasured biotic interactions affect inferences from species distribution models. Using this approach, we reanalyze one of the most important classes of mechanistic models of competition: models of consumer resource dynamics. We determine how measurements of one aspect of the environment – a single environmental variable – can be used to estimate the probability that an environment is suitable with species distribution models. We show that species distribution models, which ignore numerous facets of consumer resource dynamics such as the presence of a competitor or the dynamics of depletable resources, can furnish useful predictions for the probability that an environment is suitable in some circumstances. These results provide a rigorous link between complex mechanistic models of species interactions and species distribution models. In so doing they demonstrate that unmeasured biotic interactions can have strong and counterintuitive consequences on species distribution models.},

Computer simulation and reanalysis of paternity in Rum red deer show that correcting this error increases success in paternity assignment, and that there is a clear benefit to accommodating genotyping errors when errors are present.

abstract = {Most large-scale multispecies studies of tree growth have been conducted in tropical and cool temperate forests, whereas Mediterranean water-limited ecosystems have received much less attention. This limits our understanding of how growth of coexisting tree species varies along environmental gradients in these forests, and the implications for species interactions and community assembly under current and future climatic conditions. Here, we quantify the absolute effect and relative importance of climate, tree size and competition as determinants of tree growth patterns in Iberian forests, and explore interspecific differences in the two components of competitive ability (competitive response and effect) along climatic and size gradients. Spatially explicit neighborhood models were developed to predict tree growth for the 15 most abundant Iberian tree species using permanent-plot data from the Spanish Second and Third National Forest Inventory (IFN). Our neighborhood analyses showed a climatic and size effect on tree growth, but also revealed that competition from neighbors has a comparatively much larger impact on growth in Iberian forests. Moreover, the sensitivity to competition (i.e. competitive response) of target trees varied markedly along climatic gradients causing significant rank reversals in species performance, particularly under xeric conditions. We also found compelling evidence for strong species-specific competitive effects in these forests. Altogether, these results constitute critical new information which not only furthers our understanding of important theoretical questions about the assembly of Mediterranean forests, but will also be of help in developing new guidelines for adapting forests in this climatic boundary to global change. If we consider the climatic gradients of this study as a surrogate for future climatic conditions, then we should expect absolute growth rates to decrease and sensitivity to competition to increase in most forests of the Iberian Peninsula (in all but the northern Atlantic forests), making these management considerations even more important in the future. {\textcopyright} 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Developing adaptation measures in forestry is an urgent task because the forests regenerated today will have to cope with climate conditions that may drastically change during the life of the trees in the stand. This paper presents a comprehensive review of potential adaptation options in forestry in Europe based on three pillars: a review of the scientific literature, an analysis of current national response strategies, and an expert assessment based on a database compiled in the COST Action ECHOES (Expected Climate Change and Options for European Silviculture). The adaptation measures include responses to both risks and opportunities created by climate change and address all stages of forestry operations. Measures targeted to reduce vulnerability to climate change may either aim to reduce forest sensitivity to adverse climate change impacts or increase adaptive capacity to cope with the changing environmental conditions. Adaptation measures mitigating drought and fire risk such as selection of more drought resistant species and genotypes are crucial. For adaptation to be successful it is of the utmost importance to disseminate the knowledge of suitable adaptation measures to all decision makers from the practice to the policy level. The analysis of the ECHOES database demonstrates that this challenge is well recognized in many European countries. Uncertainty about the full extent of climate change impacts and the suitability of adaptation measures creates a need for monitoring and further research. A better understanding of how to increase adaptive capacity is also needed, as well as regional vulnerability assessments which are crucial for targeting planned adaptation measures.},

abstract = {Interaction networks are central elements of ecological systems and have very complex structures. Historically, much effort has focused on niche-mediated processes to explain these structures, while an emerging consensus posits that both niche and neutral mechanisms simultaneously shape many features of ecological communities. However, the study of interaction networks still lacks a comprehensive neutral theory. Here we present a neutral model of predator-prey interactions and analyze the structural characteristics of the simulated networks. We find that connectance values (complexity) and complexity-diversity relationships of neutral networks are close to those observed in empirical bipartite networks. High nestedness and low modularity values observed in neutral networks fall in the range of those from empirical antagonist bipartite networks. Our results suggest that, as an alternative to niche-mediated processes that induce incompatibility between species ("niche forbidden links"), neutral processes create "neutral forbidden links" due to uneven species abundance distributions and the low probability of interaction between rare species. Neutral trophic networks must be seen as the missing endpoint of a continuum from niche to purely stochastic approaches of community organization.},

abstract = {Climate change is inducing deep modifications in local communities worldwide as a consequence of individualistic species range shifts. Understanding how complex interaction networks will be reorganized under climate change represents a major challenge in the fields of ecology and biogeography. However, forecasting the potential effects of climate change on local communities, and more particularly on food-web structure, requires the consideration of highly structuring processes, such as trophic interactions. A major breakthrough is therefore expected by combining predictive models integrating habitat selection processes, the physiological limits of marine species and their trophic interactions. In this study, we forecasted the potential impacts of climate change on the local food-web structure of the highly threatened Gulf of Gabes ecosystem located in the south of the Mediterranean Sea. We coupled the climatic envelope and habitat models to an allometric niche food web model, hence taking into account the different processes acting at regional (climate) and local scales (habitat selection and trophic interactions). Our projections under the A2 climate change scenario showed that future food webs would be composed of smaller species with fewer links, resulting in a decrease of connectance, generality, vulnerability and mean trophic level of communities and an increase of the average path length, which may have large consequences on ecosystem functioning. The unified framework presented here, by connecting food-web ecology, biogeography and seascape ecology, allows the exploration of spatial aspects of interspecific interactions under climate change and improves our current understanding of climate change impacts on local marine food webs.},

abstract = {We evaluated the hypothesis that poachers reduce the abundance of herbivorous mammals, and that this, in turn, alters seed dispersal, seed predation, and seedling recruitment for two palms ( Attalea bu- tyraceae and Astrocaryum standleyanum ) in central Panama. Using physical evidence left by poachers and in- terviews with forest guards, we quantified poaching intensity for eight forest sites. We quantified mammal abundance using transect counts and small-mammal traps. Abundance was inversely related to poaching intensity for 9 of 11 mammal species (significantly so for 5 species), confirming the first component of the hy- pothesis. The outcome of interactions among seeds, mammals, and beetles also varied with poaching inten- sity. Nonvolant mammals were the only seed-dispersal agents, and rodents and beetles were the only seed predators. We quantified seed fate by examining the stony endocarps that encase the seeds of both palms. The large, durable endocarps were located easily on the forest floor and bear characteristic scars when a rodent or beetle eats the enclosed seed. The proportion of seeds dispersed away from beneath fruiting conspecifics was inversely related to poaching intensity, ranging from 85{\%} to 99{\%} at protected sites where mammals were abundant and from 3{\%} to 40{\%} at unprotected sites where poachers were most active. The proportion of dis- persed seeds destroyed by beetles was directly related to poaching intensity, ranging from 0{\%} to 10{\%} at pro- tected sites and from 30{\%} to 50{\%} at unprotected sites. The proportion of dispersed seeds destroyed by rodents was inversely related to poaching intensity, ranging from 85{\%} to 99{\%} at protected sites and from 4{\%} to 50{\%} at unprotected sites. Finally, seedling densities were directly related to poaching intensity. There was no single relationship between poaching intensity and the biotic interactions that determine seedling recruitment. The net effect of poaching on seedling recruitment can be determined only empirically. For these palms, seedling densities were directly related to poaching intensity.},

abstract = {As dispersal plays a key role in gene flow among populations, its evolutionary dynamics under environmental changes is particularly important. The inter-dependency of dispersal with other life history traits may constrain dispersal evolution, and lead to the indirect selection of other traits as a by-product of this inter-dependency. Identifying the dispersal{\~{O}}s relationships to other life-history traits will help to better understand the evolutionary dynamics of dispersal, and the consequences for species persistence and ecosystem functioning under global changes. Dispersal may be linked to other life-history traits as their respective evolutionary dynamics may be inter-dependent, or, because they are mechanistically related to each other. We identify traits that are predicted to co-vary with dispersal, and investigated the correlations that may constrain dispersal using published information on butterflies. Our quantitative analysis revealed that (1) dispersal directly correlated with demographic traits, mostly fecundity, whereas phylogenetic relationships among species had a negligible influence on this pattern, (2) gene flow and individual movements are correlated with ecological specialisation and body size, respectively and (3) routine movements only affected short-distance dispersal. Together, these results provide important insights into evolutionary dynamics under global environmental changes, and are directly applicable to biodiversity conservation.},

abstract = {The widespread occurrence of nitrogen limitation to net primary production in terrestrial and marine ecosystems is something of a puzzle; it would seem that nitrogen fixers should have a substantial competitive advantage wherever nitrogen is limiting, and that their activity in turn should reverse limitation. Nevertheless, there is substantial evidence that nitrogen limits net primary production much of the time in most terrestrial biomes and many marine ecosystems. We examine both how the biogeochemistry of the nitrogen cycle could cause limitation to develop, and how nitrogen limitation could persist as a consequence of processes that prevent or reduce nitrogen fixation. Biogeochemical mechansism that favor nitrogen limitation include: the substantial mobility of nitrogen across ecosystem boundaries, which favors nitrogen limitation in the "source" ecosystem - especially where denitrification is important in sediments and soils, or in terrestrial ecosystems where fires is frequent; differences in the biochemistry of nitrogen as opposed to phosphorus (with detrital N mostly carbon-bonded and detrital P mostly ester-bonded), which favor the development of nitrogen limitation where decomposition is slow, and allow the development of a positive feedback from nitrogen limitation to producers, to reduced decomposition of their detritus, and on to reduced nitrogen availability; and other more specialized, but perhaps no less important, processes. A number of mechanisms could keep nitrogen fixation from reversing nitrogen limitation. These include: energetic constraints on the colonization or activity of nitrogen fixers; limitation of nitrogen fixers or fixation by another nutrient (phosphorus, molybdenum, or iron) - which would then represent the ultimate factor limiting net primary production; other physical and ecological mechanisms. The possible importance of these and other processes is discussed for a wide range of terrestrial, freshwater, and marine ecosystems.},

abstract = {Ecosystem resilience is the inherent ability to absorb various disturbances and reorganize while undergoing state changes to maintain critical functions. When ecosystem resilience is sufficiently degraded by disturbances, ecosystem is exposed at high risk of shifting from a desirable state to an undesirable state. Ecological thresholds represent the points where even small changes in environmental conditions associated with disturbances lead to switch between ecosystem states. There is a growing body of empirical evidence for such state transitions caused by anthropogenic disturbances in a variety of ecosystems. However, fewer studies addressed the interaction of anthropogenic and natural disturbances that often force an ecosystem to cross a threshold which an anthropogenic disturbance or a natural disturbance alone would not have achieved. This fact highlights how little is known about ecosystem dynamics under uncertainties around multiple and stochastic disturbances. Here, we present two perspectives for providing a predictive scientific basis to the management and conservation of ecosystems against multiple and stochastic disturbances. The first is management of predictable anthropogenic disturbances to maintain a sufficient level of biodiversity for ensuring ecosystem resilience (i.e., resilience-based management). Several biological diversity elements appear to confer ecosystem resilience, such as functional redundancy, response diversity, a dominant species, a foundation species, or a keystone species. The greatest research challenge is to identify key elements of biodiversity conferring ecosystem resilience for each context and to examine how we can manage and conserve them. The second is the identification of ecological thresholds along existing or experimental disturbance gradients. This will facilitate the development of indicators of proximity to thresholds as well as the understanding of threshold mechanisms. The implementation of forewarning indicators will be critical particularly when resilience-based management fails. The ability to detect an ecological threshold along disturbance gradients should therefore be essential to establish a backstop for preventing the threshold from being crossed. These perspectives can take us beyond simply invoking the precautionary principle of conserving biodiversity to a predictive science that informs practical solutions to cope with uncertainties and ecological surprises in a changing world.},

Despite a generally positive trajectory in research surrounding model development and assessment, far too little attention has been given to prior specification. Default priors, a sub-class of non-informative prior distributions that are often chosen without critical thought or evaluation, are commonly used in practice. We believe the fear of being too ‘subjective' has prevented many researchers from using any prior information in their analyses despite the fact that defending prior choice (informative or not) promotes good statistical practice. In this commentary, we provide an overview of how BDA is currently being used in a random sample of articles, discuss implications for inference if current bad practices continue, and highlight sub-fields where knowledge about the system has improved inference and promoted good statistical practices through the careful and justified use of informative priors. We hope to inspire a renewed discussion about the use of Bayesian priors in Ecology with particular attention paid to specification and justification. We also emphasize that all priors are the result of a subjective choice, and should be discussed in that way.},

abstract = {Recent work has shown that antagonist (e.g. predator-prey food web) and mutualist (e.g. pollinator-plant) network structure can be altered by global environmental change drivers, and that these alterations may have important ecosystem-level consequences. This has prompted calls for the conservation of network structure, but precisely which attributes of webs should be conserved remains unclear. Further, the extent to which network metrics characterise the spatiotemporally-variable dynamic structure of interacting communities is unknown. Here, we summarise the attributes of web structure that are predicted to confer stability or increased function to a system, as these may be of greatest interest to conservation biologists. However, empirical evaluation of these effects is lacking in most cases, and we discuss whether stability is even desirable in all contexts. The incorporation of web attributes into conservation monitoring requires that changes in these attributes can be recorded (sampled) with relative ease. We contrast the sensitivity of metrics to sampling effort, and highlight those (such as nestedness and connectance) that could easily be incorporated into conservation monitoring. Despite our growing understanding of the characteristics of food webs that confer stability and function, numerous practical challenges need to be overcome before the goal of conserving species interaction networks can be achieved. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

We retrospectively identified genuine changes in extinction risk for mammals between 1996 and 2008 to calculate changes in the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List Index (RLI). Species-level trends in the conservation status of mammalian diversity reveal that extinction risk in large-bodied species is increasing, and that the rate of deterioration has been most accelerated in the Indomalayan and Australasian realms. Expanding agriculture and hunting have been the main drivers of increased extinction risk in mammals. Site-based protection and management, legislation, and captive-breeding and reintroduction programmes have led to improvements in 24 species. We contextualize these changes, and explain why both deteriorations and improvements may be under-reported. Although this study highlights where conservation actions are leading to improvements, it fails to account for instances where conservation has prevented further deteriorations in the status of the world's mammals. The continued utility of the RLI is dependent on sustained investment to ensure repeated assessments of mammals over time and to facilitate future calculations of the RLI and measurement against global targets.},

There is, however, an almost complete lack of knowledge on seed dispersal across altitude, a key process to understand what constrains climate-driven range shifts. Here, we report the first direct empirical evidence on altitudinal seed dispersal mediated by two common frugivorous mammals: the red fox Vulpes vulpes and the pine marten Martes martes. We conducted a three-year (bait-marking) experiment in a mountainous region of Spain. We offered experimental fruits containing colour-coded seed mimics at feeding stations that simulated source trees. The colour codes allowed us to identify the exact origin of seed mimics found later in mammal scats. Nearly half (47{\%}) of the dispersal events occurred towards higher elevations, despite only ca 25{\%} of the study area being above the average altitude of the feeding stations (1344 m). Seeds dispersed uphill gained an average of 106 m (median = 111 m) and a maximum of 288 m, greatly exceeding the estimated requirements to escape warming (35.4 m per decade). Yet, foxes mediated much more uphill seed dispersal than martens (57{\%} and 26{\%} of dispersal events, respectively), which can be explained by between-disperser differences in home range size and habitat specificity. Dispersers with larger home ranges move farther and potentially disperse more seeds to higher altitudes, while habitat generalism is necessary to transport seeds above vegetation belts delimiting contrasting habitat types. We discuss how both traits (home range size and habitat specificity) can be used to infer altitudinal seed dispersal across disperser species and mountainous landscapes. ‘This},

However, they rarely include the diversity of individual responses to environmental changes, thus hampering our understanding of demographic mechanisms. We develop an integrated integral projection model (IPM2) that is a combination of an integrated population model (IPMpop) and an integral projection model (IPMind). IPM2 includes interactions between environmental and individual effects on demographic rates and can forecast both population size and individual trait distributions. First, we study the performance of this model using eight simulated scenarios with variable reproductive selective pressures on an individual trait. When the individual trait interacts with the environmental variable and the selective pressure on the individual trait is nonlinear, only IPM2 produces adequate predictions, because IPMind does not link predictions between the population level and observed data and because IPMpop does not include the individual trait. Second, we apply IPM2 to a population of barn swallows. The model accurately predicts trends of the barn swallow population while also providing mechanistic insights. High precipitation negatively influenced population dynamics through delaying laying dates, which lowered reproductive and survival rates. To predict the future of populations, we need to understand their individual drivers and thus include individual responses to their environment while following the entire population. As a consequence, IPM2 will improve our ability to test ecological and evolutionary hypotheses and improve the accuracy of population forecasting to aid management programs.},

On the basis of this observation, ecologists have hy- pothesized that climate is the strongest determinant of species' dis- tributions at large spatial scales. However, it is difficult to reconcile this claim with the pervasive effects of biotic interactions. Here, we resolve this apparent paradox by demonstrating how biotic inter- actions can affect species' range margins yet still be compatible with model transferability.We also identify situations where small changes in species' interactions dramatically shift range margins.},

abstract = {Speciation is the "elephant in the room" of community ecology. As the ultimate source of biodiversity, its integration in ecology's theoretical corpus is necessary to understand community assembly. Yet, speciation is often completely ignored or stripped of its spatial dimension. Recent approaches based on network theory have allowed ecologists to effectively model complex landscapes. In this study, we use this framework to model allopatric and parapatric speciation in networks of communities. We focus on the relationship between speciation, richness, and the spatial structure of communities. We find a strong opposition between speciation and local richness, with speciation being more common in isolated communities and local richness being higher in more connected communities. Unlike previous models, we also find a transition to a positive relationship between speciation and local richness when dispersal is low and the number of communities is small. We use several measures of centrality to characterize the effect of network structure on diversity. The degree, the simplest measure of centrality, is the best predictor of local richness and speciation, although it loses some of its predictive power as connectivity grows. Our framework shows how a simple neutral model can be combined with network theory to reveal complex relationships between speciation, richness, and the spatial organization of populations.},

abstract = {A range of policy initiatives have been promoted in recent years to address the decline of bee populations in Europe and North America. Among these has been the establishment of flower-rich habitat within or around intensively farmed landscapes to increase the availability of pollen and nectar resources. The composition of these habitats depends on location and compatibility with adjacent cropping systems, but they often consist of fields planted with temporary flowering cover crops, field borders with perennial or annual flowering species, hedgerows comprising prolifically flowering shrubs, and grass buffer strips (used to manage erosion and nutrient runoff) which are supplemented with dicotyledonous flower species. While the primary objective of such measures is to increase the ecological fitness of pollinator populations through enhanced larval and adult nutrition, such strategies also provide secondary benefits to the farm and the surrounding landscape. Specifically, the conservation of pollinator habitat can enhance overall biodiversity and the ecosystem services it provides (including pest population reduction), protect soil and water quality by mitigating runoff and protecting against soil erosion, and enhance rural aesthetics. Incorporating these secondary benefits into decision making processes is likely to help stakeholders to assess the trade-offs implicit in supplying ecosystem services. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Neglect of ecological knowledge is a limiting factor in the use of statistical modelling to predict species distribution. Three components are needed for statistical modelling, an ecological model concerning the ecological theory to be used or tested, a data model concerning the collection and measurement of the data, and a statistical model concerning the statistical theory and methods used. This component framework is reviewed with emphasis on ecological theory. The expected shape of a species response curve to an environmental gradient is a central assumption on which agreement has yet to be reached. The nature of the environmental predictors whether indirect variables, e.g. latitude that have no physiological impact on plants, or direct variables, e.g. temperature also influence the type of response expected. Straight-line relationships between organisms and environment are often used uncritically. Many users of canonical correlation analysis use linear (straight-line) functions to relate ordination axes to variables such as slope and aspect though this is not a necessary part of the method. Some statisticians have used straight lines for species/environment relationships without testing, when evaluating new statistical procedures. Assumptions used in one component often conflict with those in another component. Statistical models can be used to explore ecological theory. Skewed species response curves predominate contrary to the symmetric unimodal curves assumed by some statistical methods. Improvements in statistical modelling can be achieved based on ecological concepts. Examples include incorporating interspecific competition from dominant species; more proximal predictors based on water balance models and spatial autocorrelation procedures to accommodate non-equilibrium vegetation. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Aim The study and prediction of species-environment relationships is currently mainly based on species distribution models. These purely correlative models neglect spatial population dynamics and assume that species distributions are in equilibrium with their environment. This causes biased estimates of species niches and handicaps forecasts of range dynamics under environmental change. Here we aim to develop an approach that statistically estimates process-based models of range dynamics from data on species distributions and permits a more comprehensive quantification of forecast uncertainties. Innovation We present an approach for the statistical estimation of process-based dynamic range models (DRMs) that integrate Hutchinson's niche concept with spatial population dynamics. In a hierarchical Bayesian framework the environmental response of demographic rates, local population dynamics and dispersal are estimated conditional upon each other while accounting for various sources of uncertainty. The method thus: (1) jointly infers species niches and spatiotemporal population dynamics from occurrence and abundance data, and (2) provides fully probabilistic forecasts of future range dynamics under environmental change. In a simulation study, we investigate the performance of DRMs for a variety of scenarios that differ in both ecological dynamics and the data used for model estimation. Main conclusions Our results demonstrate the importance of considering dynamic aspects in the collection and analysis of biodiversity data. In combination with informative data, the presented framework has the potential to markedly improve the quantification of ecological niches, the process-based understanding of range dynamics and the forecasting of species responses to environmental change. It thereby strengthens links between biogeography, population biology and theoretical and applied ecology. {\textcopyright} 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

We propose an integrative framework linking ecological theory, empirical data and statistical models to understand the distribution of species and their abundances together with the underlying community assembly dynamics. We illustrate our approach with 21 plant species in the French Alps. We show that a spatially nested modelling framework significantly improves the model's performance and that the spatial variations of species presence-absence and abundances are predominantly explained by different factors. We also show that incorporating abiotic, dispersal and biotic factors into the same model bring new insights to our understanding of community assembly.

abstract = {Gene flow between cultivars within a landscape may lead to impurities that reduce harvest value. In OSR, as for most crops, impurity rates are expected to depend on the spatial distribution of crops over the landscape. However, in contrast to other well-studied crops such as maize, OSR crops generate seed banks in European agro-ecosystems. Gene flow is thus a spatio-temporal process which depends on cropping systems. We therefore aimed at identifying spatial variables that have an effect on regional or local harvest impurities, taking account of the time since the introduction of OSR crops in the regions and of cropping system. Gene flow was simulated over 36 field patterns cultivated with either 15{\%} or 30{\%} of OSR fields, among which 10{\%} or 50{\%} were GM, for three contrasted cropping systems, with the GeneSys software already used for EU co-existence studies. Through regression analyses, we determined spatial and agronomic factors that most affected harvest impurity rates of non-GM OSR after one or seven years of OSR cultivation. The cropping system was the main factor explaining regional harvest impurity rates. Its importance increased after six years of OSR cultivation. For a given cropping system, the regional impurity rate after one year increased linearly with the current proportion of GM crop. In contrast, impurity rates after six years largely depended on the proportions of OSR crop (GM or not) in the two preceding years. During the first year of OSR cultivation, local impurity rates were mostly explained by the distance to the closest GM field. After six years, these rates were mostly explained by the density of GM volunteers in the analysed field and, to a lesser degree, to that of volunteers in neighbour non-OSR fields. Cropping systems were most important in determining impurity rates and the way impurity rates related to regional or local factors. Determination of isolation distances to ensure harvest purity should thus consider past history of OSR cultivation in the area and, in particular, how current or future cropping systems will manage volunteers. Regression quantiles were fitted to the simulated data to determine regional rules (i.e. the maximum regional area of GM OSR and isolation distances between GM and non-GM crops) as a function of the risk accepted by the decision-maker (i.e. the {\%} of situations exceeding harvest impurity thresholds), the cropping system and the volunteer infestation. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The results demonstrated that there was a small regeneration ratio and the sexual ratio was around 1:1, as previously expected for the species.

abstract = {Tree mortality is a key factor influencing forest functions and dynamics, but our understanding of the mechanisms leading to mortality and the associated changes in tree growth rates are still limited. We compiled a new pan-continental tree-ring width database from sites where both dead and living trees were sampled (2970 dead and 4224 living trees from 190 sites, including 36 species), and compared early and recent growth rates between trees that died and those that survived a given mortality event. We observed a decrease in radial growth before death in ca. 84{\%} of the mortality events. The extent and duration of these reductions were highly variable (1–100 years in 96{\%} of events) due to the complex interactions among study species and the source(s) of mortality. Strong and long-lasting declines were found for gymnosperms, shade- and drought-tolerant species, and trees that died from competition. Angiosperms and trees that died due to biotic attacks (especially bark-beetles) typically showed relatively small and short-term growth reductions. Our analysis did not highlight any universal trade-off between early growth and tree longevity within a species, although this result may also reflect high variability in sampling design among sites. The intersite and interspecific variability in growth patterns before mortality provides valuable information on the nature of the mortality process, which is consistent with our understanding of the physiological mechanisms leading to mortality. Abrupt changes in growth immediately before death can be associated with generalized hydraulic failure and/or bark-beetle attack, while long-term decrease in growth may be associated with a gradual decline in hydraulic performance coupled with depletion in carbon reserves. Our results imply that growth-based mortality algorithms may be a powerful tool for predicting gymnosperm mortality induced by chronic stress, but not necessarily so for angiosperms and in case of intense drought or bark-beetle outbreaks.},

In this paper, I discuss a variety of factors, in addition to competition, that influence the observed relationship between species distribution and the availability of suitable habitat. In particular, I show that Hutchinson's niche concept can be modified to incorporate the influences of niche width, habitat availability and dispersal, as well as interspecific competition per se. I introduce a simulation model called NICHE that embodies many of Hutchinson's original niche concepts and use this model to predict patterns of species distribution. The model may help to clarify how dispersal, niche size and competition interact, and under what conditions species might be common in unsuitable habitat or absent from suitable habitat. A brief review of the pertinent literature suggests that species are often absent from suitable habitat and present in unsuitable habitat, in ways predicted by theory. However, most tests of niche theory are hampered by inadequate consideration of what does and does not constitute suitable habitat. More conclusive evidence for these predictions will require rigorous determination of habitat suitability under field conditions. I suggest that to do this, ecologists must measure habitat specific demography and quantify how demographic parameters vary in response to temporal and spatial variation in measurable niche dimensions},

abstract = {We investigate the consequences of global warming scenarios in Quebec forests using an inhomogeneous Markov chain model. This allows us to unify predictions from climate change models and mechanistic models of forest disturbance and growth and allows predicting the potential impacts of climate change on Quebec forests. The model predicts changes in fire rate in Quebec hardwood forests as well as possible growth enhancements due to increasing inline image and temperature. Our original method consists of three steps. (i) We estimate biomass transition matrices from forest inventories using the Bayesian method. (ii) We incorporate dynamic disturbance and forest growth scenarios, and (iii) we simulate transient dynamics and stationary states. This modelling approach allows for sensitivity analysis and quantitative assessment effects of variability of climate change scenarios. We have considered published climate change scenarios for Quebec and conducted simulations for the most extreme predictions (the smallest and largest predicted changes). None of the considered scenarios is able to counterbalance the currently observed trend of increasing biomass in the next 40 years. By the beginning of 2090, the extreme scenarios diverge within about ±5{\%} mean biomass. Synthesis. In this work, we have developed an original modelling approach incorporating time- inhomogeneous effects within the Markov chain framework. We applied this approach to examine effects of climate change in Quebec's forests. The results demonstrate that the current trend of increase in forest biomass is robust with respect to a broad range of climate change scenarios. This study was not possible with previously employed homogeneous Markov chain models. The model can also be extended to include different harvesting methods and land-use practices, enabling better long-term management of Quebec's forest.},

abstract = {The objective of science is to understand the natural world; we argue that prediction is the only way to demonstrate scientific understanding, implying that prediction should be a fundamental aspect of all scientific disciplines. Reproducibility is an essential requirement of good science and arises from the ability to develop models that make accurate predictions on new data. Ecology, however, with a few exceptions, has abandoned prediction as a central focus and faces its own crisis of reproducibility. Models are where ecological understanding is stored and they are the source of all predictions – no prediction is possible without a model of the world. Models can be improved in three ways: model variables, functional relationships among dependent and independent variables, and in parameter estimates. Ecologists rarely test to assess whether new models have made advances by identifying new and important variables, elucidating functional relationships, or improving parameter estimates. Without these tests it is difficult to know if we understand more today than we did yesterday. A new commitment to prediction in ecology would lead to, among other things, more mature (i.e. quantitative) hypotheses, prioritization of modeling techniques that are more appropriate for prediction (e.g. using continuous independent variables rather than categorical) and, ultimately, advancement towards a more general understanding of the natural world.},

abstract = {1. To test hypotheses concerning adaptation and acclimation of tree species to shaded habitats we determined the growth, biomass partitioning and morphology of seedlings of nine near-boreal tree species in high- and low-light greenhouse environment (25 and 5{\%} of full sunlight, respectively), comparable to sunlit gap and shaded microsites in boreal forests. The species differ widely in shade tolerance, seed size and leaf life span. 2. In low light, all species allocated proportionally more biomass to stems and less to roots, but the same to foliage, compared with the high-light environment. At a common size, all species had finer leaf morphology (higher specific leaf area, SLA) but coarser root morphology (lower specific root length, SRL) in low than high light. From a whole plant perspective, all species enhanced leaf area per unit plant mass (leaf area ratio, LAR) in low light and root length per unit plant mass (root length ratio, RLR) in high light. 3. Shade-intolerant deciduous species had higher RGR, SLA and SRL than larger seeded evergreens: ranking from Populus, Betula and Larix spp., then to five evergreen Pinus, Picea and Thuja spp., which were generally comparable in these traits. There were no changes in growth rankings of species between high- and low-light environments, nor consistent differences among species in biomass partitioning. Hence, species differences in leaf and root morphology (SLA, SRL) drove whole plant patterns, such as Populus, Betula and Larix had greater total leaf area and root length per unit plant mass (LAR and RLR, respectively) than the evergreens. Interspecific variation in RGR in both high and low light was positively correlated (r ≃ 0.9) with SLA, SRL, LAR and RLR, and negatively correlated (r ≃ -0.9) to seed mass and leaf life span. 4. These data suggest that SLA, SRL, NAR and RGR are closely associated with variation in life-history traits and that variation in leaf and root structure more strongly influences patterns of RGR among species and light environments than does biomass partitioning.},

abstract = {The effects of the present biodiversity crisis have been largely focused on the loss of species. However, a missed component of biodiversity loss that often accompanies or even precedes species disappearance is the extinction of ecological interactions. Here, we propose a novel model that (i) relates the diversity of both species and interactions along a gradient of environmental deterioration and (ii) explores how the rate of loss of ecological functions, and consequently of ecosystem services, can be accelerated or restrained depending on how the rate of species loss covaries with the rate of interactions loss. We find that the loss of species and interactions are decoupled, such that ecological interactions are often lost at a higher rate. This implies that the loss of ecological interactions may occur well before species disappearance, affecting species functionality and ecosystems services at a faster rate than species extinctions. We provide a number of empirical case studies illustrating these points. Our approach emphasizes the importance of focusing on species interactions as the major biodiversity component from which the 'health' of ecosystems depends.},

abstract = {Tree regeneration is a key process for long-term forest dynamics, determining changes in species composition and shaping successional trajectories. While tree regeneration is a highly stochastic process, tree regeneration studies often cover narrow environmental gradients only, focusing on specific forest types or species in distinct regions. Thus, the larger-scale effects of temperature, water availability, and stand structure on tree regeneration are poorly understood. We investigated these effects in respect of tree recruitment (in-growth) along wide environmental gradients using forest inventory data from Flanders (Belgium), northwestern Germany, and Switzerland covering more than 40 tree species. We employed generalized linear mixed models to capture the abundance of tree recruitment in response to basal area, stem density, shade casting ability of a forest stand as well as site-specific degree-day sum (temperature), water balance, and plant-available water holding capacity. We grouped tree species to facilitate comparisons between species with different levels of tolerance to shade and drought. Basal area and shade casting ability of the overstory had generally a negative impact on tree recruitment, but the effects differed between levels of shade tolerance of tree recruitment in all study regions. Recruitment rates of very shade-tolerant species were positively affected by shade casting ability. Stem density and summer warmth (degree-day sum) had similar effects on all tree species and successional strategies. Water-related variables revealed a high degree of uncertainty and did not allow for general conclusions. All variables had similar effects independent of the varying diameter thresholds for tree recruitment in the different data sets. Synthesis: Shade tolerance and stand structure are the main drivers of tree recruitment along wide environmental gradients in temperate forests. Higher temperature generally increases tree recruitment rates, but the role of water relations and drought tolerance remains uncertain for tree recruitment on cross-regional scales.},

O Ktze.) growing on different sites in southern Brazil and to formulate silvicultural strategies for producing high quality timber for this species. Data on four hundreds trees in both natural and planted forests were collected on temporary sample plots each containing 25 Parana pines. The size of the knotty core within Parana pine stems was modeled with the predictor variables height of the lowest dead branch, height to crown base and maximum radial increment of stem at 1.3 m. The results of our study show that crown width is a good estimator of diameter growth and is closely related to stem diameter at 1.3 m above ground. Restricting crown expansion such that average annual radial increment is 4 mm/year at 1.3 m for a stem grown for 63 years compared to one grown for 36 years with less crown restriction such that the average annual radial increment is about 75{\%} greater (7 mm/year) results in a knotty core volume that is about 75{\%} less for the slower growing tree. Managers can use this model to guide silvicultural decisions needed to achieve the production goal of high quality wood of Parana pine.},

Inbreeding, SGS and realized patterns of pollen and seed dispersal of the dioecious, wind pollinated Araucaria angustifolia were investigated based on microsatellite loci. The study was conducted in a 7.2 ha plot established within a continuous Araucaria Forest in Southern Brazil. In the plot, all 290 adult trees were mapped, measured (diameter at breast height, dbh), sexed, sampled and genotyped. We also sampled, measured (total height), mapped and genotyped 223 juveniles. A total of 86 alleles were detected in the sample (n = 513). Adults and juveniles showed a positive and significant fixation index (minimum of 0.096), suggesting inbreeding or Wahlund effect. Juveniles presented a significant aggregated distribution which was associated with a genetic aggregation (significant SGS up to 20 m), indicating that near neighbor trees may be related due the limited seed dispersal. However, the intensity of SGS was not significantly higher among juveniles (Sp = 0.0041) than adults (Sp = 0.0026). Realized pollen and seed immigration into the plot was low (pollen = 6 {\%}; seeds = 5 {\%}) and the patterns of pollen and seed dispersal were similar. Pollen was dispersed over long distances (343 m), but 50 {\%} was dispersed up to 124 m. Seeds also reached long distances (318 m), with 50 {\%} being dispersed up to 133 m.

Paternity analysis using six microsatellite loci identified a pollen source for 45{\%} of seedlings, and the remainder were assumed to have arisen from pollen sources outside the stands. Outcrossing was variable, ranging from 52 to 89{\%}, and long distance pollen dispersal was observed in all populations with up to 65{\%} of pollen sourced from outside the populations over distances of at least 1 km. Modelling dispersal functions for pollination events within the two larger populations showed little difference between the four two-parameter models tested and indicated a fat-tailed dispersal curve. Similarity of direct and indirect historical estimates of gene flow indicates maintenance of gene flow at levels experienced prior to fragmentation. The study revealed extensive long distance pollen dispersal in remnant patches of trees within a fragmented agricultural landscape in the southern temperate region and highlighted the role of remnant patches in maintaining genetic connectivity at the landscape scale.},

abstract = {Models predicting photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) in heterogeneous canopies are an essential component of process-based weed dynamics models for assessing integrated weed management strategies. Most existing light availability models either consider only homogeneous canopies or are based on optical principles that are too complex for multi-annual and large-scale simulations required for evaluating weed dynamics. The TROLL model adopted a simpler approach, discretizing the canopy into cubic volume cells (“voxels”) and successively calculating PAR transmitted between voxel layers as a function of leaf area and extinction coefficient in each voxel. The present study aimed at developing at a simple, generic individual-based 3D model predicting light availability and interception in heterogeneous canopies for subsequent introduction into a weed dynamics model called FlorSys. In a first step, TROLL was adapted to crop:weed canopies for arable crops in temperate latitudes by (1) developing a new function adapted to annuals for describing plant morphology, (2) accounting for lateral light transmission as a function of solar angle, and (3) predicting the variation in lateral transmission with season and latitude. In the second step, the predictions produced by the FlorSys light availability model were compared to PAR measurements in heterogeneous crop stands. The model was shown to rank situations correctly and to predict incident PAR satisfactorily. A sensitivity analysis of FlorSys identified the voxel size optimizing prediction quality. In the last step, simulations were run to evaluate the potential of biological weed regulation via crop:weed competition for light. The present model will be connected to emergence, growth and development models in further studies.},

abstract = {Models are pivotal for assessing future forest dynamics under the impacts of changing climate and management practices, incorporating representations of tree growth, mortality, and regeneration. Quantitative studies on the importance of mortality submodels are scarce. We evaluated 15 dynamic vegetation models (DVMs) regarding their sensitivity to different formulations of tree mortality under different degrees of climate change. The set of models comprised eight DVMs at the stand scale, three at the landscape scale, and four typically applied at the continental to global scale. Some incorporate empirically derived mortality models, and others are based on experimental data, whereas still others are based on theoretical reasoning. Each DVM was run with at least two alternative mortality submodels. Model behavior was evaluated against empirical time series data, and then, the models were subjected to different scenarios of climate change. Most DVMs matched empirical data quite well, irrespective of the mortality submodel that was used. However, mortality submodels that performed in a very similar manner against past data often led to sharply different trajectories of forest dynamics under future climate change. Most DVMs featured high sensitivity to the mortality submodel, with deviations of basal area and stem numbers on the order of 10–40{\%} per century under current climate and 20–170{\%} under climate change. The sensitivity of a given DVM to scenarios of climate change, however, was typically lower by a factor of two to three. We conclude that (1) mortality is one of the most uncertain processes when it comes to assessing forest response to climate change, and (2) more data and a better process understanding of tree mortality are needed to improve the robustness of simulated future forest dynamics. Our study highlights that comparing several alternative mortality formulations in DVMs provides valuable insights into the effects of process uncertainties on simulated future forest dynamics.},

abstract = {The biodiversity-ecosystem functioning (BEF) relationship is central in community ecology. Its drivers in competitive systems (sampling effect and functional complementarity) are intuitive and elegant, but we lack an integrative understanding of these drivers in complex ecosystems. Because networks encompass two key components of the BEF relationship (species richness and biomass flow), they provide a key to identify these drivers, assuming that we have a meaningful measure of functional complementarity. In a network, diversity can be defined by species richness, the number of trophic levels, but perhaps more importantly, the diversity of interactions. In this paper, we define the concept of trophic complementarity (TC), which emerges through exploitative and apparent competition processes, and study its contribution to ecosystem functioning. Using a model of trophic community dynamics, we show that TC predicts various measures of ecosystem functioning, and generate a range of testable predictions. We find that, in addition to the number of species, the structure of their interactions needs to be accounted for to predict ecosystem productivity.},

abstract = {Theories of island biogeography and of relative species abundance are of central importance in biogeography and community ecology, yet these two bodies of theory heretofore have been largely unconnected. Incorporating speciation into the theory of island biogeography unexpectedly results in unification of these two theories. The unified theory predicts the existence of a fundamental biodiversity number $\theta$ that controls not only species richness, but also relative species abundance in the source area metacommunity at equilibrium between speciation and extinction. With additional parameters for island size and migration rate, the theory also predicts relative species abundance on islands or local regions of continuous landscapes. Application of the theory to the biogeography and biodiversity of communities of tropical trees and reef-building corals are discussed. One important result is that only relatively modest migration rates are sufficient to dynamically couple the regional metacommunity and stabilize community structure on large spatiotemporal scales. Thus, regional, long-term compositional stasis in tropical rain forests and coral reefs can arise just as easily from the stabilizing effect of large numbers as from niche-assembly rules that limit species membership in communities. Because of the higher intrinsic vagility of corals, the theory predicts greater regional similarity in coral reef communities than in tropical tree communities. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 1997.},

We tested this hypothesis with Central American agoutis and Astrocaryum standleyanum palm seeds on Barro Colorado Island, Panama. We radio-tracked seeds as they were cached and re-cached by agoutis, calculated the density of adult Astrocaryum trees surrounding each cache, and tested whether the observed number of trees around seed caches declined more than expected under random dispersal. Seedling establishment success was negatively dependent on seed density, and agoutis carried seeds towards locations with lower conspecific tree densities, thus facilitating the escape of seeds from natural enemies. This behaviour may be a widespread mechanism leading to highly effective seed dispersal by scatter-hoarding animals.},

Here we assess determinants of climatic debt accumulated in French forest herbaceous plant communities between 1987 and 2008 (that is, a 1.05 °C mean difference between the observed and bioindicated temperatures). We show that warmer baseline conditions predispose plant communities to larger climatic debts, and that climate warming exacerbates this response. Forest plant communities, however, are absorbing part of the temperature increase mainly through the species' ability to tolerate changing climate. As climate warming is expected to accelerate during the twenty-first century, plant migration and tolerance to climatic stresses probably will be insufficient to absorb this impact posing threats to the sustainability of forest plant communities.},

abstract = {Population demography is central to fundamental ecology and for predicting range shifts, decline of threatened species, and spread of invasive organisms. There is a mismatch between most demographic work, carried out on few populations and at local scales, and the need to predict dynamics at landscape and regional scales. Inspired by concepts from landscape ecology and Markowitz's portfolio theory, we develop a landscape portfolio platform to quantify and predict the behavior of multiple populations, scaling up the expectation and variance of the dynamics of an ensemble of populations. We illustrate this framework using a 35-y time series on gypsy moth populations. We demonstrate the demography accumulation curve in which the collective growth of the ensemble depends on the number of local populations included, highlighting a minimum but adequate number of populations for both regional-scale persistence and cross-scale inference. The attainable set of landscape portfolios further suggests tools for regional population management for both threatened and invasive species.},

Here, we review the population and forest dynamics models that, when parameterized with data from population studies, forest inventories, or tree rings, have been used for identifying life-history strategies of species and threat-related changes in population demography and dynamics. The available evidence suggests that slow-growing and/or long-lived species are the most vulnerable. However, a lack of comparative, multi-species studies still challenges more precise predictions of the vulnerability of tree species to threats. Improving data coverage for mortality and recruitment, and accounting for interactions among threats, would greatly advance vulnerability assessments for conservation prioritizations of trees worldwide.},

abstract = {The extent that biotic interactions and dispersal influence species ranges and diversity patterns across scales remains an open question. Answering this question requires framing an analysis on the frontier between species distribution modelling (SDM), which ignores biotic interactions and dispersal limitation, and community ecology, which provides specific predictions on community and meta-community structure and resulting diversity patterns such as species richness and functional diversity. Using both empirical and simulated datasets, we tested whether predicted occurrences from fine-resolution SDMs provide good estimates of community structure and diversity patterns at resolutions ranging from a resolution typical of studies within reserves (250 m) to that typical of a regional biodiversity study (5 km). For both datasets, we show that the imprint of biotic interactions and dispersal limitation quickly vanishes when spatial resolution is reduced, which demonstrates the value of SDMs for tracking the imprint of community assembly processes across scales.},

All rights reserved Organic production of blackberries is increasing, but there is relatively little known about how production practices affect plant and soil nutrient status. The impact of cultivar (Black Diamond and Marion), weed management (nonweeded, hand-weeded, and weed mat), primocane training time (August and February), and irrigation (throughout the summer and none postharvest) on plant nutrient status and soil pH, organic matter, and nutrients was evaluated from Oct. 2012 to Dec. 2014 in a mature trailing blackberry (Rubus L. subgenus Rubus Watson) production system. The study site was certified organic and machine harvested for the processed market. The planting was irrigated by drip and fertigated with fish hydrolysate and fish emulsion fertilizer. Soil pH, organic matter content, and concentrations of soil nutrients, including ammonium-nitrogen (NH4-N), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), sulfur (S), copper (Cu), manganese (Mn), and zinc (Zn), were greater under weed mat than in hand-weeded plots. Soil K and boron (B) were below recommended standards during the study, despite a high content of K in the fish fertilizer and supplemental B applications. Primocane leaf nutrient concentrations were below the N, K, Ca, and Mg sufficiency standards in ‘Black Diamond' and were lower than in ‘Marion' for N, phosphorus (P), Ca, Mg, S, B, and Zn in at least one year. In contrast, floricane leaves and fruit tended to have higher nutrient concentrations in ‘Black Diamond' than in ‘Marion'. Weed management strategy affected many nutrients in the soil, leaves, and fruit. Often, use of weed mat led to the highest concentrations. Withholding irrigation postharvest had limited effects on plant nutrient concentrations. Primocane training time affected the nutrients in each plant part differently depending on year.},

Somewhat analogously, hierarchical approaches to community-level data have been developed to gain insights into community-level processes, and to improve species-level inference by borrowing information from other species that are either ecologically or phylogenetically related to the focal species. We unify spatial and community-level structures by developing spatially explicit joint species distribution models. The models utilize spatially structured latent factors to model missing covariates as well as species-to-species associations in a statistically and computationally effective manner. We illustrate that the inclusion of the spatial latent factors greatly increases the predictive performance of the modelling approach with a case study of 55 species of butterfly recorded on a 10 km x 10 km grid in Great Britain consisting of 2,609 grid cells.},

abstract = {Interest in using native grass species for restoration is increasing, yet little is known about the ecology and genetics of native grass populations or the spatial scales over which seed can be transferred and successfully grown. The purpose of this study was to investigate the genetic structure within and among populations of Elymus glaucus in order to make some preliminary recommendations for the transfer and use of this species in revegetation and restoration projects. Twenty populations from California, Oregon, and Washington were analyzed for allozyme genotype at 20 loci, and patterns of variation within and among populations were determined. Allozyme variation at the species level was high, with 80{\%} of the loci polymorphic and an average expected heterozygosity (an index of genetic diversity) of 0.194. All but two of the populations showed some level of polymorphism. A high degree of population differentiation was found, with 54.9{\%} of the variation at allozyme loci partitioned among populations (F-st = 0.549). A lesser degree of genetic differentiation among closely spaced subpopulations within one of the populations was also demonstrated (F-st = 0.124). Self-pollination and the patchy natural distribution of the species both likely contribute to the low level of gene flow (Nm = 0.205) that was estimated. Zones developed for the transfer of seed of commercial conifer species may be inappropriate for transfer of E. glaucus germplasm because conifer species are characterized by high levels of gene flow. Limited gene flow in E. glaucus can facilitate the divergence of populations over relatively small spatial scales. This genetic differentiation can be due to random genetic drift, localized selective pressures, or both. In order to minimize the chances of planting poorly adapted germplasm, seed of E. glaucus may need to be collected in close proximity to the proposed restoration site.},

However, the TIB remains silent about functional trait com-position and provides no information on the scaling of functional diversity with area, an observation that is now documented in many systems. To fill this gap, we develop a probabilistic approach to predict the distribution of a trait as a function of habitat area and isolation, extend-ing the TIB beyond the traditional species–area relationship. We compare model predictions to the body-size distribution of piscivorous and herbivorous fishes found on tropical reefs worldwide. We find that small and isolated reefs have a higher proportion of large-sized species than large and connected reefs. We also find that knowledge of species body-size and trophic position improves the predictions of fish occupancy on tropical reefs, supporting both the allometric and trophic theory of island biogeography. The integration of functional ecology to island biogeogra-phy is broadly applicable to any functional traits and provides a general probabilistic approach to study the scaling of trait distribution with habitat area and isolation.},

abstract = {Aim: Natural and human-induced differences in frugivore assemblages can influence the seed dispersal distances of trees. An important issue in seed dispersal systems is to understand whether differences in seed dispersal distances also affect the genetic structure of mature trees. One possible approach to test for a relationship between seed dispersal and the genetic structure of mature trees is to compare the genetic structure of two closely related tree species between two biogeographical regions that differ in frugivore assemblages and seed dispersal distances. Previous studies on two Commiphora species revealed that Commiphora guillauminii in Madagascar has a much lower seed dispersal distance than Commiphora harveyi in South Africa. We tested whether the lower seed dispersal distance might have caused decreased gene flow, resulting in a stronger genetic structure in Madagascar than in South Africa. Location: Madagascar and South Africa. Methods: Using amplified fragment length polymorphism markers we investigated the genetic structure of 134 trees in Madagascar and 158 trees in South Africa at a local and a regional spatial scale. Results: In concordance with our hypothesis, kinship analysis suggests that gene flow was restricted mostly to 3 km in Madagascar and to 30 km in South Africa. At the local spatial scale, the genetic differentiation among groups of trees within sample sites was marginally significantly higher in Madagascar (FST = 0.069) than in South Africa (FST = 0.021). However, at a regional spatial scale genetic differentiation was lower in Madagascar (FST = 0.053) than in South Africa (FST = 0.163). Main conclusions: Our results show that lower seed dispersal distances of trees were linked to higher genetic differentiation of trees only at a local spatial scale. This suggests that seed dispersal affects the genetic population structure of trees at a local, but not at a regional, spatial scale. -� 2008 The Authors},

abstract = {Global warming will jeopardize the persistence and genetic diversity of many species. Assisted colonization, or the movement of species beyond their current range boundary, is a conservation strategy proposed for species with limited dispersal abilities or adaptive potential. However, species that rely on photoperiodic and thermal cues for development may experience conflicting signals if transported across latitudes. Relocating multiple, distinct populations may remedy this quandary by expanding genetic variation and promoting evolutionary responses in the receiving habitat - a strategy known as assisted gene flow. To better inform these policies, we planted seeds from latitudinally distinct populations of the annual legume, Chamaecrista fasciculata, in a potential future colonization site north of its current range boundary. Plants were exposed to ambient or elevated temperatures via infrared heating. We monitored several life history traits and estimated patterns of natural selection to determine the adaptive value of plastic responses. To assess the feasibility of assisted gene flow between phenologically distinct populations, we counted flowers each day and estimated the degree of temporal isolation between populations. Increased temperatures advanced each successive phenological trait more than the last, resulting in a compressed life cycle for all but the southern-most population. Warming altered patterns of selection on flowering onset and vegetative biomass. Population performance was dependent on latitude of origin, with the northern-most population performing best under ambient conditions and the southern-most performing most poorly, even under elevated temperatures. Among-population differences in flowering phenology limited the potential for genetic exchange among the northern- and southern-most populations. All plastic responses to warming were neutral or adaptive; however, photoperiodic constraints will likely necessitate evolutionary responses for long-term persistence, especially when involving populations from disparate latitudes. With strategic planning, our results suggest that assisted colonization and assisted gene flow may be feasible options for preservation.},

abstract = {Survival rates of large trees determine forest biomass dynamics. Survival rates of small trees have been linked to mechanisms that maintain biodiversity across tropical forests. How species survival rates change with size offers insight into the links between biodiversity and ecosystem function across tropical forests. We tested patterns of size-dependent tree survival across the tropics using data from 1,781 species and over 2 million individuals to assess whether tropical forests can be characterized by size-dependent life-history survival strategies. We found that species were classifiable into four ‘survival modes' that explain life-history variation that shapes carbon cycling and the relative abundance within forests. Frequently collected functional traits, such as wood density, leaf mass per area and seed mass, were not generally predictive of the survival modes of species. Mean annual temperature and cumulative water deficit predicted the proportion of biomass of survival modes, indicating important links between evolutionary strategies, climate and carbon cycling. The application of survival modes in demographic simulations predicted biomass change across forest sites. Our results reveal globally identifiable size-dependent survival strategies that differ across diverse systems in a consistent way. The abundance of survival modes and interaction with climate ultimately determine forest structure, carbon storage in biomass and future forest trajectories.},

abstract = {Introduced top predators have the potential to disrupt community dynamics when prey species are naive to predation. The impact of introduced predators may also vary depending on the stage of community development. Early-succession communities are likely to have small-bodied and fast-growing species, but are not necessarily good at defending against predators. In contrast, late-succession communities are typically composed of larger-bodied species that are more predator resistant relative to small-bodied species. Yet, these aspects are greatly neglected in invasion studies. We therefore tested the effect of top predator presence on early- and late-succession communities that were either naive or non-naive to top predators. We used the aquatic community held within the leaves of Sarracenia purpurea. In North America, communities have experienced the S. purpurea top predator and are therefore non-naive. In Europe, this predator is not present and its niche has not been filled, making these communities top-predator naive. We collected early- and late-succession communities from two non-naive and two naive sites, which are climatically similar. We then conducted a common-garden experiment, with and without the presence of the top predator, in which we recorded changes in community composition, body size spectra, bacterial density, and respiration. We found that the top predator had no statistical effect on global measures of community structure and functioning. However, it significantly altered protist composition, but only in naive, early-succession communities, highlighting that the state of community development is important for understanding the impact of invasion.},

abstract = {The range of potential mechanisms limiting species' distributions in space is nearly as varied and complex as the diversity of life itself. Yet viewed abstractly, a species' border is a geographic manifestation of a species' demographic responses to a spatially and temporally varying world. Population dynamic models provide insight into the different routes by which range limits can arise owing to gradients in demographic rates. In a metapopulation context, for example, range limits may be caused by gradients in extinction rates, colonization rates or habitat availability. We have consider invasion models in uniform and heterogeneous environments as a framework for understanding non-equilibrium range limits, and explore conditions under which invasions may cease to spread leaving behind a stationary range limit. We conclude that non-equilibrial range dynamics need further theoretical and empirical attention.},

abstract = {Australia's natural temperate grasslands have diminished to 0.5 {\%} of their former area since European settlement and, as a consequence, are highly fragmented and modified. Many vertebrate species that live in temperate grasslands are habitat specialists and therefore are at risk of decline through habitat loss and fragmentation. The grassland earless dragon (Tympanocryptis pinguicolla) is one such species. Once widespread, T. pinguicolla is now restricted to two general locations; the first is near Canberra in the Australian Capital Territory (including some adjacent land near Queanbeyan), and the second is the Monaro Tablelands in New South Wales. Here, we use microsatellite DNA data collected from the largest remaining populations near Canberra to examine genetic structure in this species in the context of the rapidly expanding urban landscape in this region. Our study revealed that, despite separation by only relatively small distances (largest distance similar to 13 km), the T. pinguicolla populations are highly genetically structured with little admixture. Our analyses also revealed that the population with the largest census size, but which has recently crashed in population size, exhibited little detectable gene flow to other populations and is essentially isolated. Our data indicate that significant barriers to dispersal exist among the remaining T. pinguicolla populations and that management of this species cannot rely on natural dispersal to bolster declining populations. Many different agencies and landholders are responsible for the protection of these remnant populations and a co-ordinated effort is required to provide reasonable confidence that the species will persist.},

abstract = {Seed dispersal determines the conditions that seeds, seedlings, and saplings confront, and thus potentially provides a unifying theme for plant population ecology. This potential is seldom realized, however, because dispersal is infrequently linked effectively with its consequences. We advocate the importance of explicitly designing studies quantifying spatial patterns of dispersal at a variety of scales, causes of those spatial patterns, and consequences of alternative patterns of dispersal for all stages from seed to new adult. It is critical to link this chain of events with thorough investigations of individual dispersal systems rather than continuing to collect small pieces of the story from a multitude of systems. We first present a brief overview of spatial patterns, causes, and consequences of dispersal. We then develop the argument that a correspondence, or lack of correspondence, between patterns of seed arrival and adult recruitment tells little about causal relationships between the two. Finally, we suggest that a combination of observational and experimental approaches taking into account the complexities of recruitment processes will better link dispersal with its consequences. Experimental manipulations of patterns of seed arrival and causal modelling are potentially powerful approaches, but may be limited in application to easily manageable species.},

abstract = {There is increasing interest in understanding the costs and benefits of increased size and prolonged lifespan for plants. Some species of trees can grow more than 100 m in height and can live for several millennia, however whether these achievements are obtained at the cost of some other physiological functions is currently unclear. As increases in size are usually associated with ageing, it is also unclear whether observed reductions in growth rates and increased mortality rates are a function of size or of age per se. One theory proposes that reduced growth after the start of the reproductive phase is caused by cellular senescence. A second set of theories has focussed instead on plant size and the increased respiratory burdens or excessive height. We report on experimental manipulations to separate the effects of extrinsic factors such as size from those of intrinsic factors such as age for four tree species of contrasting phylogeny and life history. For each species, we measured growth, gas exchange and leaf biochemical properties for trees of different ages and sizes in the field and on propagated material obtained from the same genetic individuals but now all of small similar size in our common gardens. For all species, evidence indicated that size, not cellular senescence, accounted for the observed age-related declines in relative growth rates and net assimilation rates. Two species exhibited evidence of genetic control on leaf characters such as specific leaf area, although size also exerted an independent, and stronger, effect. We found partial support for the theory of hydraulic limitations to tree growth. The lack of a marked separation of soma and germline, an unlimited proliferation potential of meristem cells and the exponential increase in reproductive effort with size all help explain the lack of a senescence-induced decline in trees. It is possible that trees much older than the ones we sampled exhibit senescence symptoms.},

Methods We examine fine-scale changes in the plant communities of a coastal grassland over a 30-year period in which spring temperatures increased by 1.4 degrees C. We look at whether changes in community composition and local colonizations and extinctions are related to microclimatic conditions. Results Our findings suggest that while community reassembly was consistent with warming, changes were smaller on cooler, north-facing slopes. Closer inspection of the patterns of species turnover revealed that species with low temperature requirements were able to persist on cooler slopes, while those with high moisture requirements suffered similar decreases in occupancy across all microclimates. Main conclusions Our results suggest that cooler slopes may act as microrefugia, buffering the effects on plant communities of increases in temperature by delaying extinctions of species with low temperature requirements.},

abstract = {Demand for alternative energy sources has led to increased interest in intensive biomass production. When applied across a broad spatial extent, intensive biomass production in forests, which support a large proportion of biodiversity, may alter species composition, nutrient cycling and subsequently biodiversity. Because forest thinning and fuels treatment thinning are viewed as possible wide-spread biomass harvest options, it is important to understand what is known about forest biodiversity response to these practices and what additional information is needed by forest managers and policymakers. Therefore, we summarized documented relationships between forest thinning treatments and forest biodiversity from 505 biodiversity effect sizes (incl. taxa and guild abundance and species richness measures) from 33 studies conducted across North America. We used meta-analysis to summarize biodiversity response by region, taxa and harvest treatments. Biodiversity responses included species richness, diversity, abundance of taxa or groups of species (guilds) and abundance of individual species for birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians, and invertebrates. Forest thinning treatments had generally positive or neutral effects on diversity and abundance across all taxa, although thinning intensity and the type of thinning conducted may at least partially drive the magnitude of response. Our review highlights the need for more research to determine effects of thinning on amphibians and reptiles and manipulative experiments designed to test the effects of biomass removal on biodiversity. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The Wollemi pine (Wollemia nobilis) is a rare Southern conifer with striking morphological similarity to fossil pines. A small population of W. nobilis was discovered in 1994 in a remote canyon system in the Wollemi National Park (near Sydney, Australia). This population contains fewer than 100 individuals and is critically endangered. Previous genetic studies of the Wollemi pine have investigated its evolutionary relationship with other pines in the family Araucariaceae, and have suggested that the Wollemi pine genome contains little or no variation. However, these studies were performed prior to the widespread use of genome sequencing, and their conclusions were based on a limited fraction of the Wollemi pine genome. In this study, we address this problem by determining the entire sequence of the W. nobilis chloroplast genome. A detailed analysis of the structure of the genome is presented, and the evolution of the genome is inferred by comparison with the chloroplast sequences of other members of the Araucariaceae and the related family Podocarpaceae. Pairwise alignments of whole genome sequences, and the presence of unique pseudogenes, gene duplications and insertions in W. nobilis and Araucariaceae, indicate that the W. nobilis chloroplast genome is most similar to that of its sister taxon Agathis. However, the W. nobilis genome contains an unusually high number of repetitive sequences, and these could be used in future studies to investigate and conserve any remnant genetic diversity in the Wollemi pine.},

abstract = {We studied mortality caused by the last spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana Clem.) outbreak (1972-1984) and the subsequent regeneration processes in the mixed conifer-hardwood forest zone of the T{\'{e}}miscamingue region, western Qu{\'{e}}bec. Three kinds of late successional stands, undisturbed by human activities and representative of forest conditions on different sites, were studied using permanent plots, dendrochronology, and field data. The tree species affected directly by the spruce budworm, balsam fir (Abies balsamea L.), white spruce (Picea glauca Moench.), and black spruce (Picea mariana Mill.) suffered high overall mortality rates during the 1972-1996 period covered by the permanent plot measurements (97.6, 63.5, and 59.6{\%}, respectively). The mortality of balsam fir and white spruce were positively correlated with pre-outbreak balsam fir basal area in the plots, as was the mortality of a non-host species, white birch (Betula papyrifera Marsh.). Mortality of host and non-host species following the outbreak might have been due in part to modified environmental conditions following canopy disruption, particularly on imperfectly drained sites that were dominated by balsam fir before the outbreak. This is also supported by the fact that radial increments of surviving white spruce trees remained significantly lower after the outbreak in balsam fir-dominated stands compared with other stand types. The outbreak has also favoured the emergence of an abundant sapling layer mostly dominated by balsam fir. Due to important fluctuations in the shape of canopy gaps over the years, the correlations between sapling abundance and actual canopy openings are low for all sapling species. In the present-day mixed species stands, density and species composition of the sapling layer seem to depend more on the presence of suitable micro-sites than canopy openings. These results suggest that the last outbreak gave rise to a gradient of stand regeneration patterns, depending on species composition before the outbreak and host and non-host mortality following it, ranging from overall stand mortality and replacement in balsam fir-dominated stands, dual-cohort structures in mixed boreal stands where mortality was partial, and quasi-gap dynamics in mixed hardwood stands dominated by yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis Britton). {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Here, we analysed the genetic structure of Cyclamen purpurascens, a mountainous calcicolous perennial, to test hypotheses regarding its glacial survival in single or multiple refugia and postglacial colonization routes, and to explore how they are congruent with the histories inferred for temperate trees and other mountainous herbs. We gathered AFLP data and chloroplast DNA sequences (trnD-trnT region) from 68 populations spanning the entire distribution range (the Jura Mountains, Alps, western Carpathians, Dinarides). Both genetic markers revealed two main phylogeographical groups (phylogroups) in C.purpurascens. Additionally, AFLP data detected a more detailed structure of five phylogroups: two widespread, showing east-west geographical separation, and three local ones, restricted to somewhat disjunct, marginal regions of the species range. We suggest that C.purpurascens survived the last glaciation in two main regions, the foothills of the Southern Limestone Alps and the Karst area of the north-western Dinarides, and possibly also in microrefugia in the Western Carpathians. The glacial persistence and colonization routes of this woodland herb are highly concordant with those inferred for several temperate trees, especially the European beech. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Linnean Society of London.},

In this paper, we explore how ecologists might move forward on this question. We first outline the conditions under which biotic interactions can result in range shifts that proceed faster or slower than climate velocity and result in ecological surprises. Next, we use our own work to demonstrate that experimental studies documenting the strength of biotic interactions across large environmental gradients are a critical first step for understanding whether they will influence climate change–induced range shifts. Further progress could be made by integrating results from these studies into modeling frameworks to predict how or generalize when biotic interactions mediate how changing climates influence range shifts. Finally, we argue that many more case studies like those described here are needed to explore the importance of biotic interactions during climate change–induced range shifts.},

abstract = {Abstract In an era of global environmental change, understanding how disturbance affects the dynamics of ecological communities is crucial. However, few studies have theoreti- cally explored the potential influence of disturbance including both intensity and fre- quency on compositional change over time in communities with stage structure. A spatially explicit, individual- based model was constructed incorporating the various demographic responses to disturbance of plants at two different growth stages: seed- lings and adults. In the model, we assumed that individuals within each stage were demographically equivalent (neutral) but differed between stages. We simulated a common phenomenon that seedlings suffered more from disturbance such as grazing and fire than adults. We showed how stage- structured communities of seedlings and adults responded to disturbance with various levels of disturbance frequency and in- tensity. In “undisturbed” simulations, the relationship between average species abun- dance (defined here as the total number of individuals divided by species richness) and community composition turnover (measured by the Bray–Curtis similarity index) was asymptotic. However, in strongly “disturbed” simulations with the between- disturbance intervals greater than one, this relationship became unimodal. Stage- dependent response to disturbance underlay the above discrepancy between undisturbed and disturbed communities.},

abstract = {This study investigates patterns of genetic connectivity among 11 co-distributed tropical rainforest tree species from the genus Elaeocarpus across a biogeographic barrier, the Black Mountain Corridor (BMC) in the Australian Wet Tropics (AWT). We analysed a combination of allelic and flanking region sequence data from microsatellite markers, and evaluated the relative influence of environmental preferences and functional traits on genetic diversity and gene flow. The results indicate that only in three species geographic structuring of haplotype distribution reflects a north vs. south of the BMC pattern. Environmental factors linked with altitude were recognized as affecting genetic trends, but the selective processes operating on upland species appear to be associated with competitiveness and regeneration opportunities on poor soil types rather than climate variables alone. In contrast to previous observations within southeastern Australian rainforests, genetic differentiation in the AWT appears to be associated with small-fruited rather than large-fruited species, highlighting how external factors can influence the dispersal dimension. Overall, this study emphasizes the importance of considering functional and environmental factors when attempting generalizations on landscape-level patterns of genetic variation. Understanding how plant functional groups respond to environmental and climatic heterogeneity can help us predict responses to future change.},

abstract = {Dispersal of plant propagules by ocean currents can result in long-distance dispersal and is important for the persistence of coastal species. However, the ability of such species to disperse via the ocean is often unknown because there is relatively little evidence that demonstrates that seeds or fruits can float and survive for extended periods in seawater. Furthermore, the seed or fruit traits, and intraspecific variation in these traits, that facilitate buoyancy remain largely unidentified. The genus Scaevola (L.) contains several widespread coastal species that may be capable of oceanic dispersal, such as S. crassifolia (Labill). We collected fruits of S. crassifolia along 700km of a latitudinal environmental gradient. These fruits were used to determine the influence of fruit morphology and anatomy on fruit buoyancy. Morphological and anatomical variation in S. crassifolia was associated with dispersal potential. Our empirical data demonstrated that fruits with larger aeriferous mesocarp layers have greater buoyancy and, therefore, enhanced capacity for long range oceanic dispersal. Of three characters hypothesised to affect buoyancy (aeriferous mesocarp, air pockets in empty locules, and number of vascular cavities), only the properties of the mesocarp were significant. Intraspecific variation can significantly affect dispersal potential, and should not be overlooked in dispersal ecology. {\textcopyright} CSIRO 2014.},

abstract = {Coexistence theory has been developed with an almost exclusive focus on interactions between two species, often ignoring more complex and indirect interactions, such as intransitive loops, that can emerge in competition networks. In fact, intransitive competition has typically been studied in isolation from other pairwise stabilising processes, and thus little is known about how intransitivity interacts with more traditional drivers of species coexistence such as niche partitioning. To integrate intransitivity into traditional coexistence theory, we developed a metric of growth rate when rare, Dr i , to identify and quantify the impact of intransitive competition against a backdrop of pairwise stabilising niche differences. Using this index with simulations of community dynam-ics, we demonstrate that intransitive loops can both stabilise or destabilise species coexistence, but the strength and importance of intransitive interactions are significantly affected by the length and the topology of these loops. We conclude by showing how Dr i can be used to evaluate effects of intransitivity in empirical studies. Our results emphasise the need to integrate complex mecha-nisms emerging from diverse interactions into our understanding of species coexistence.},

To investigate the local chemical environment in relation to function we performed saturation mutagenesis of the loop L2 region (amino acid positions 193-212) using a site-directed mutagenesis procedure, and determined the recombinational proficiency of the 380 mutants using genetic assays for homologous recombination and recombinational repair. Residues Asn193, Gln194, Arg196, Glu207, Thr209, Gly211, and Gly212 were identified as stringently required for recombinational events in bacterial cells. In addition, our findings suggest the involvement of loop L2 in the ATPase activity of RecA, and a role for residues Gln194, Arg196, Lys198 and Thr209 in the DNA-dependent hydrolysis of ATP. Finally, since 20 residue peptides that comprise this region can pair homologous DNAs by forming filamentous $\beta$-structures, we propose how the information from the mutant analysis might facilitate the use of a simplified amino acid alphabet to design $\beta$-structure forming L2 peptides with improved RecA-like activities.},

Because northeast Brazil is the most threatened sector of South American Atlantic forest, our results highlight the need to change the current conservation paradigm for this region.

Location: Araucaria forest and Campos grassland mosaic in southern Brazilian highlands (29°29'S, 50°12'W). Methods: We collected data on the density of forest woody species in plots located on rocky outcrops and in open fields subject to different management regimes. We evaluated the influence of outcrops on the density of forest plants {\textless}60 cm tall, and the effects of other environmental variables and of site on plant density; we also used information on diaspore traits of the species to discuss the way in which plants disperse to the outcrops. Results: Rocky outcrops harbored a significantly higher density of forest plants than open fields, irrespective of site effect, and rock height was the best predictor for plant density on outcrops. Diaspores of all recorded species possess characteristics associated with dispersal by birds or mammals or by both. Conclusions: Small rocky outcrops markedly influence forest expansion by acting as perches for vertebrate dispersers and as nurse objects and safe sites for plants. Forest expansion starting in small outcrops possibly occurs as follows: perching of dispersers and increase of seed rain on rocks, promotion of better conditions of establishment for forest plants by nurse rocks, protection of plants sensitive to grazing and fire, and nucleation of forest vegetation. {\textcopyright} 2010 International Association for Vegetation Science.},

abstract = {Biodiversity is organised into complex ecological networks of interacting species in local ecosystems, but our knowledge about the effects of habitat fragmentation on such systems remains limited. We consider the effects of this key driver of both local and global change on both mutualistic and antagonistic systems at different levels of biological organisation and spatiotemporal scales.There is a complex interplay of patterns and processes related to the variation and influence of spatial, temporal and biotic drivers in ecological networks. Species traits (e.g. body size, dispersal ability) play an important role in determining how networks respond to fragment size and isolation, edge shape and permeability, and the quality of the surrounding landscape matrix. Furthermore, the perception of spatial scale (e.g. environmental grain) and temporal effects (time lags, extinction debts) can differ markedly among species, network modules and trophic levels, highlighting the need to develop a more integrated perspective that considers not just nodes, but the structural role and strength of species interactions (e.g. as hubs, spatial couplers and determinants of connectance, nestedness and modularity) in response to habitat fragmentation.Many challenges remain for improving our understanding: the likely importance of specialisation, functional redundancy and trait matching has been largely overlooked. The potentially critical effects of apex consumers, abundant species and super-generalists on network changes and evolutionary dynamics also need to be addressed in future research. Ultimately, spatial and ecological networks need to be combined to explore the effects of dispersal, colonisation, extinction and habitat fragmentation on network structure and coevolutionary dynamics. Finally, we need to embed network approaches more explicitly within applied ecology in general, because they offer great potential for improving on the current species-based or habitat-centric approaches to our management and conservation of biodiversity in the face of environmental change. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

We compared eight models ranging from niche-based to process-based models. On average, models project large range contractions of temperate tree species in lowlands due to climate change. There was substantial disagreement between models for temperate broadleaf deciduous tree species, but differences in the capacity of models to account for rising CO2 impacts explained much of the disagreement. There was good quantitative agreement among models concerning the range contractions for Scots pine.

Ever since May's provocative paper challenging whether ‘large complex systems [are] stable' various hypotheses have been proposed to explain when stability should be the rule, not the exception. Spatial dynamics may be stabilizing and thus explain high community diversity, yet existing theory on spatial stabilization is limited, preventing comparisons of the role of dispersal relative to species interactions. Here we incorporate dispersal of organisms and material into stability–complexity theory. We find that stability criteria from classic theory are relaxed in direct proportion to the number of ecologically distinct patches in the meta-ecosystem. Further, we find the stabilizing effect of dispersal is maximal at intermediate intensity. Our results highlight how biodiversity can be vulnerable to factors, such as landscape fragmentation and habitat loss, that isolate local communities. 1De},

abstract = {Individual-based forest simulators, such as TASS and SORTIE, are spatial stochastic processes that predict properties of populations and communities by simulating the fate of every plant throughout its life cycle. Although they are used for forest management and are able to predict dynamics of real forests, they are also analytically intractable, which limits their usefulness to basic scientists. We have developed a new spatial individual-based forest model that includes a perfect plasticity formulation for crown shape. Its structure allows us to derive an accurate approximation for the individual-based model that predicts mean densities and size structures using the same parameter values and functional forms, and also it is analytically tractable. The approximation is represented by a system of von Foerster partial differential equations coupled with an integral equation that we call the perfect plasticity approximation (PPA). We have derived a series of analytical results including equilibrium abundances for trees of different crown shapes, stability conditions, transient behaviors, such as the constant yield law and self-thinning exponents, and two species coexistence conditions. {\textcopyright} 2008 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract = {During the last 50 years, agricultural intensification has caused many wild plant and animal species to go extinct regionally or nationally and has profoundly changed the functioning of agro-ecosystems. Agricultural intensification has many components, such as loss of landscape elements, enlarged farm and field sizes and larger inputs of fertilizer and pesticides. However, very little is known about the relative contribution of these variables to the large-scale negative effects on biodiversity. In this study, we disentangled the impacts of various components of agricultural intensification on species diversity of wild plants, carabids and ground-nesting farmland birds and on the biological control of aphids. In a Europe-wide study in eight West and East European countries, we found important negative effects of agricultural intensification on wild plant, carabid and bird species diversity and on the potential for biological pest control, as estimated from the number of aphids taken by predators. Of the 13 components of intensification we measured, use of insecticides and fungicides had consistent negative effects on biodiversity. Insecticides also reduced the biological control potential. Organic farming and other agri-environment schemes aiming to mitigate the negative effects of intensive farming on biodiversity did increase the diversity of wild plant and carabid species, but - contrary to our expectations - not the diversity of breeding birds. We conclude that despite decades of European policy to ban harmful pesticides, the negative effects of pesticides on wild plant and animal species persist, at the same time reducing the opportunities for biological pest control. If biodiversity is to be restored in Europe and opportunities are to be created for crop production utilizing biodiversity-based ecosystem services such as biological pest control, there must be a Europe-wide shift towards farming with minimal use of pesticides over large areas. ?? 2009 Gesellschaft f??r ??kologie.},

abstract = {We evaluated the response of the Earth land biomes to drought by correlating a drought index with three global indicators of vegetation activity and growth: vegetation indices from satellite imagery, tree-ring growth series, and Aboveground Net Primary Production (ANPP) records. Arid and humid biomes are both affected by drought, and we suggest that the persistence of the water deficit (i.e., the drought time-scale) could be playing a key role in determining the sensitivity of land biomes to drought. We found that arid biomes respond to drought at short time-scales; that is, there is a rapid vegetation reaction as soon as water deficits below normal conditions occur. This may be due to the fact that plant species of arid regions have mechanisms allowing them to rapidly adapt to changing water availability. Humid biomes also respond to drought at short time-scales, but in this case the physiological mechanisms likely differ from those operating in arid biomes, as plants usually have a poor adaptability to water shortage. On the contrary, semiarid and subhumid biomes respond to drought at long time-scales, probably because plants are able to withstand water deficits, but they lack the rapid response of arid biomes to drought. These results are consistent among three vegetation parameters analyzed and across different land biomes, showing that the response of vegetation to drought depends on characteristic drought time-scales for each biome. Understanding the dominant time-scales at which drought most influences vegetation might help assessing the resistance and resilience of vegetation and improving our knowledge of vegetation vulnerability to climate change.},

Height and diameter development, as well as annual growth of stem volume and stem biomass, were repeatedly recorded in 14 planted and 2 root sucker stands, aged up to 26 years, in southern Sweden. A main aim was to study the productivity level for hybrid aspen forestry with an expected rotation period of about 25 years. The study verified earlier prognoses, showing a mean annual increment (MAI) of 19.5 m(3) of stem wood ha(-1) yr(-1) after 25 years. This corresponds to a dry weight of stem biomass of 7.2 tons dry matter (DM) ha(-1) yr(-1). Maximum MAI was still not reached after 25 years, although the growth curve was flattening out. If branch biomass is included, MAI is estimated to about 9 tons DM ha(-1) yr(-1) and further improvements in growth is expected by using the best genotypically selected clones available. Results from three different thinning regimens showed that thinning intensity provided significantly larger diameter growth, while no significant yield effects were seen among the thinning regimens.},

abstract = {There is increasing interest in understanding the costs and benefits of increased size and prolonged lifespan for plants. Some species of trees can grow more than 100 m in height and can live for several millennia, however whether these achievements are obtained at the cost of some other physiological functions is currently unclear. As increases in size are usually associated with ageing, it is also unclear whether observed reductions in growth rates and increased mortality rates are a function of size or of age per se. One theory proposes that reduced growth after the start of the reproductive phase is caused by cellular senescence. A second set of theories has focussed instead on plant size and the increased respiratory burdens or excessive height. We report on experimental manipulations to separate the effects of extrinsic factors such as size from those of intrinsic factors such as age for four tree species of contrasting phylogeny and life history. For each species, we measured growth, gas exchange and leaf biochemical properties for trees of different ages and sizes in the field and on propagated material obtained from the same genetic individuals but now all of small similar size in our common gardens. For all species, evidence indicated that size, not cellular senescence, accounted for the observed age-related declines in relative growth rates and net assimilation rates. Two species exhibited evidence of genetic control on leaf characters such as specific leaf area, although size also exerted an independent, and stronger, effect. We found partial support for the theory of hydraulic limitations to tree growth. The lack of a marked separation of soma and germline, an unlimited proliferation potential of meristem cells and the exponential increase in reproductive effort with size all help explain the lack of a senescence-induced decline in trees. It is possible that trees much older than the ones we sampled exhibit senescence symptoms. {\textcopyright}2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

abstract = {Models that describe the spread of invading organisms often assume that the dispersal distances of propagules are normally distributed. In contrast, measured dispersal curves are typically leptokurtic, not normal. In this paper, we consider a class of models, integrodifference equations, that directly incorporate detailed dispersal data as well as population growth dynamics. We provide explicit formulas for the speed of invasion for compensatory growth and for different choices of the propagule redistribution kernel and apply these formulas to the spread of D. pseudoobscura. We observe that: (1) the speed of invasion of a spreading population is extremely sensitive to the precise shape of the redistribution kernel and, in particular, to the tail of the distribution; (2) fat-tailed kernels can generate accelerating invasions rather than constant-speed travelling waves; (3) normal redistribution kernels (and by inference, many reaction-diffusion models) may grossly underestimate rates of spread of invading populations in comparison with models that incorporate more realistic leptokurtic distributions; and (4) the relative superiority of different redistribution kernels depends, in general, on the precise magnitude of the net reproductive rate. The addition of an Allee effect to an integrodifference equation may decrease the overall rate of spread. An Allee effect may also introduce a critical range; the population must surpass this spatial threshold in order to invade successfully. Fat-tailed kernels and Allee effects provide alternative explanations for the accelerating rates of spread observed for many invasions.},

This task is particularly urgent in the Arctic, where globalwarming is most pronounced3 . Here we report the results of an international collaboration on the direct and indirect effects of climate on the functioning of Arctic terrestrial ecosystems. Our data from seven terrestrial food webs spread along a wide range of latitudes (∼1,500km) and climates (?mean July temperature = 8.5 ◦ C) across the circumpolar world show the effects of climate on tundra primary production, food-web structure and species interaction strength. The intensity of predation on lower trophic levels increased significantly with temperature, at approximately 4.5{\%} per ◦ C. Temperature also affected trophic interactions through an indirect effect on food-web structure (that is, diversity and number of interactions). Herbivore body sizewas a major determinant of predator–prey interactions, as interaction strength was positively related to the predator–prey size ratio, with large herbivores mostly escaping predation. There is potential for climate warming to cause a switch from bottom-up to top-down regulation of herbivores. These results are critical to resolving the debate on the regulation of tundra and other terrestrial ecosystems exposed to global change},

abstract = {The identification of patterns in life-history strategies across the tree of life is essential to our prediction of population persistence, extinction, and diversification. Plants exhibit a wide range of patterns of longevity, growth, and reproduction, but the general determinants of this enormous variation in life history are poorly understood. We use demographic data from 418 plant species in the wild, from annual herbs to supercentennial trees, to examine how growth form, habitat, and phylogenetic relationships structure plant life histories and to develop a framework to predict population performance. We show that 55{\%} of the variation in plant life-history strategies is ade-quately characterized using two independent axes: the fast–slow continuum, including fast-growing, short-lived plant species at one end and slow-growing, long-lived species at the other, and a repro-ductive strategy axis, with highly reproductive, iteroparous species at one extreme and poorly reproductive, semelparous plants with frequent shrinkage at the other. Our findings remain consistent across major habitats and are minimally affected by plant growth form and phylogenetic ancestry, suggesting that the relative inde-pendence of the fast–slow and reproduction strategy axes is general in the plant kingdom. Our findings have similarities with how life-history strategies are structured in mammals, birds, and reptiles. The position of plant species populations in the 2D space produced by both axes predicts their rate of recovery from disturbances and population growth rate. This life-history framework may comple-ment trait-based frameworks on leaf and wood economics; to-gether these frameworks may allow prediction of responses of plants to anthropogenic disturbances and changing environments. life history strategy | iteroparity | generation time | matrix population model | phylogenetic signal D emographic schedules of survival, growth, and reproduction, which comprise life-history strategies, are fundamental to our understanding of a range of ecological and evolutionary processes, such as invasions and local extinctions (1–3), com-munity structure (4, 5), and species diversification (6, 7). Con-sequently, the development and careful testing of theory on how organisms allocate resources to survival, growth, and reproduction are important goals for evolutionary biology, ecology, and conser-vation biology (8). Indeed, calls for the development of a " periodic table " to classify species based on their life-history strategies and to predict population dynamics and community composition go back to the early development of evolutionary biology as a discipline (9). A main axiom of life-history theory is that trade-offs (i.e., bud-getary compromises) between different aspects of an organism's demographic schedules, such as survival, growth, and/or re-production, constrain and optimize the range of possible life-history strategies that can evolve across the tree of life (10, 11). However, the plant kingdom encompasses a vast amount of life-history variation; plant longevity, for instance, ranges from weeks to millennia (12). Many plant species' life cycles include cryptic life stages such as seedbanks (13) or dormant adults (similar to animal hibernation) (14). Reproduction also can be highly vari-able among plants, with seed mass and per-capita seed pro-duction ranging across six orders of magnitude (15). Previous classifications of plant life-history strategies have been limited in geographic (16, 17), taxonomic, and phylogenetic scales (17) and in the ability to differentiate life-history trade-offs (17–19). Here we propose an approach analogous to that developed decades ago for vertebrates (20) to study the drivers behind plant life-history variation. We combine demographic, phylogenetic, and ecological data from natural populations of 418 plant species worldwide (Fig. 1) to address the following questions: (i) What are the main axes of variation of plant life-history strategies? (ii) To what extent do phylogenetic ancestry, habitat, growth form, and size constrain plant life-history variation? We then test whether the position of a species on these axes predicts two important metrics of population performance: population growth rate and speed of recovery from disturbances. If clear patterns emerge, they may form the basis for a satisfactory classification and predictive},

abstract = {The New Texas serpentine barrens is a rare, naturalsavanna in southeastern PA that is rapidly succeeding to forest, probably as a result of fire exclusion. We tested the hypothesis that the invasive tree, Pinus virginiana, is modifying soil conditions in a way that may promote conversion to forest. We analyzed soil (1) next to P. virginiana of different ages and sizes and at varying distances from these trees and (2) in early successional savanna sites versus late succession forest sites. Mineral soil depth and litter depth increased with size of and proximity to trees and from savanna to forest, suggesting that P. virginiana exerts strong effects on soil at the tree scale that lead to similar changes at the stand level. Individual P. virginiana also appear to increase organic matter and Ca:Mg ratio, a key indicator of serpentine infertility. These soil chemical trends, however, were not replicated at the stand level: forest soils actually had similar or lower nutrient and organic matter levels than early successional savanna and exhibited no difference in Ca:Mg ratio. Differences between soil development trends on the two scales may be related to slower decomposition rates in pine forest compared to grassland, although much more complex mechanisms may also be involved. Although P. virginiana does not, at the stand level, appear to ameliorate soil chemical imbalances endemic to serpentine soils, its positive influence on soil depth alone could promote further succession towards forests typical of non-serpentine sites in the region},

abstract = {People depend on benefits provided by ecological systems. Understanding how these ecosystem services - and the ecosystem properties underpinning them - respond to drivers of change is therefore an urgent priority. We address this challenge through developing a novel risk-assessment framework that integrates ecological and evolutionary perspectives on functional traits to determine species' effects on ecosystems and their tolerance of environmental changes. We define Specific Effect Function (SEF) as the per-gram or per capita capacity of a species to affect an ecosystem property, and Specific Response Function (SRF) as the ability of a species to maintain or enhance its population as the environment changes. Our risk assessment is based on the idea that the security of ecosystem services depends on how effects (SEFs) and tolerances (SRFs) of organisms - which both depend on combinations of functional traits - correlate across species and how they are arranged on the species' phylogeny. Four extreme situations are theoretically possible, from minimum concern when SEF and SRF are neither correlated nor show a phylogenetic signal, to maximum concern when they are negatively correlated (i.e., the most important species are the least tolerant) and phylogenetically patterned (lacking independent backup). We illustrate the assessment with five case studies, involving both plant and animal examples. However, the extent to which the frequency of the four plausible outcomes, or their intermediates, apply more widely in real-world ecological systems is an open question that needs empirical evidence, and suggests a research agenda at the interface of evolutionary biology and ecosystem ecology.},

We then conduct simulation experiments with empirical population models to quantify the relative influence of these factors on the synchrony of dominant species in five semiarid grasslands. We found that the average synchrony of per capita growth rates, which can range from 0 (perfect asynchrony) to 1 (perfect synchrony), was higher when environmental variation was present (0.62) rather than absent (0.43). Removing interspecific interactions and demographic stochasticity had small effects on synchrony. For the dominant species in these plant communities, where species interactions and demographic stochasticity have little influence, synchrony reflects the covariance in species' responses to the environment.},

abstract = {This paper describes a stand growth model, based on physiological processes, which incorporates a number of steps and procedures that have allowed considerable simplification relative to extant process based models. The model, called 3-PG (use of Physiological Principles in Predicting Growth), calculates total carbon fixed (gross primary production; P(G)) from utilizable, absorbed photosynthetically active radiation ($\phi$(p.a.u)), obtained by correcting the photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by the forest canopy ($\phi$(p.a.)) for the effects of soil drought, atmospheric vapour pressure deficits and stand age. P(G) is obtained from $\phi$(p.a.u) and the canopy quantum efficiency, values of which are becoming available. The ratio of net (P(N)) to gross primary production is emerging as relatively constant for trees. This eliminates the need to calculate respiration and is used to estimate P(N)-the net amount of carbon converted to biomass. 3-PG uses a simple relationship to estimate the amount of carbon allocated below ground and a procedure based on allometric ratios-widely available for many species and situations to determine the allocation of carbon to foliage and stems and constrain tree growth patterns. The effects of nutrition are incorporated through the carbon allocation procedure; the amount of carbon allocated below ground will increase with decreasing soil fertility. Recently acquired knowledge about the physiological factors causing decline in forest growth rates with age is used to model that decline. Changes in stem populations (self-thinning) are derived from a procedure based on the -3/2 power law, combined with stem growth rates. The model requires weather data as input, works on monthly time steps and has been run for periods up to 120 years, producing realistic patterns of stem growth and stern diameter increments. The time course of leaf area index is realistic for a range of soil conditions and atmospheric constraints. 3-PG can be run from remotely-sensed estimates of leaf area index coupled to weather data and basic, readily available information about soils and stand characteristics. It is being tested as a practical tool against forestry data from New South Wales, Tasmania, Victoria and New Zealand. Test results show excellent correspondence between stand growth measurements and simulated stem growth over 30 years.},

There are 1094 species with documented ecological impacts and 1347 with economic impacts. The two taxonomic groups with the most species causing impacts are terrestrial invertebrates and terrestrial plants. The North Sea is the maritime region that suffers the most impacts. Across taxa and regions, ecological and economic impacts are highly correlated. Terrestrial invertebrates create greater economic impacts than ecological impacts, while the reverse is true for terrestrial plants. Alien species from all taxonomie groups affect "supporting", "provisioning", "regulating", and "cultural" services and interfere with human well-being. Terrestrial vertebrates are responsible for the greatest range of impacts, and these are widely distributed across Europe.

Examples include the spread of infectious diseases, eco-evolutionary dynamics and rapid evolution, mechanisms underlying invasions and extinctions, and forest productivity.

abstract = {The distribution of saccate and nonsaccate pollen in modem conifers (nomenclature after Page 1990) shows a correlation with the method of pollen capture by the micropyle, although this has been little emphasized. Saccate pollen is restricted to, but not ubiquitous in, Phyllocladaceae, Pinaceae, and Podocarpaceae and is associated with the development of an inverted pollination drop, except in Phyllocladus. Saccate pollen is also nonwettable, in the sense that it floats on water, and it functions as a distinctive antigravity device. Pollen entry into the micropyle is dependent on resorption of the pollination drop and selectively excludes foreign particles. Nonsaccate pollen is wettable and sinks in water, but with two contrasted behaviors that discriminate two types of pollen reception. In Cephalotaxaceae, Cupressaceae, Sciadopityaceae, Taxaceae, and Taxodiaceae there is a pollination drop without preferred orientation. Pollen swells and bursts in water, shedding the exine by a mechanism determined by the apparently simple wall structure. In the remaining conifers with nonsaccate pollen-Agathis, Araucaria, i.e., Araucariaceae, together with Larix, Pseudotsuga, and Tsuga (Pinaceae) and Saxegothaea (Podocarpaceae)-there is no pollination drop, pollen is wettable but does not burst in water, and there is either extended siphonogamy or micropylar invagination. These observations show the adaptive features of pollen structure and ultrastructure. Despite their ubiquitous wind pollination, conifers thus have some diversity of pollination syndromes with reference to water and the introduction of pollen into the pollen chamber of the ovule, at which time pollination is complete.},

Another process now regularly classified as a neutral force, limited dispersal, represents a fundamental demographic process that is not neutral with respect to species differences, but rather differs among species in important ways. Finally, I suggest that the dramatic shift in ecological research to focus on neutrality could have a cost in terms of scientific understanding and relevance to real biodiversity threats. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The problem of scale has been a critical impediment to incorporating important fine-scale processes into global ecosystem models. Our knowledge of fine-scale physiological and ecological processes comes from a variety of measurements, ranging from forest plot inventories to remote sensing, made at spatial resolutions considerably smaller than the large scale at which global ecosystem models are defined. In this paper, we describe a new individual-based, terrestrial biosphere model, which we label the ecosystem demography model (ED). We then introduce a general method for scaling stochastic individual-based models of ecosystem dynamics (gap models) such as ED to large scales. The method accounts for the fine-scale spatial heterogeneity within an ecosystem caused by stochastic disturbance events, operating at scales down to individual canopy-tree-sized gaps. By conditioning appropriately on the occurrence of these events, we derive a size-and age-structured (SAS) approximation for the first moment of the stochastic ecosystem model. With this approximation, it is possible to make predictions about the large scales of interest from a description of the fine-scale physiological and population-dynamic processes without simulating the fate of every plant individually. We use the SAS approximation to implement our individual-based biosphere model over South America from 15° N to 15° S, showing that the SAS equations are accurate across a range of environmental conditions and resulting ecosystem types. We then compare the predictions of the biosphere model to regional data and to intensive data at specific sites. Analysis of the model at these sites illustrates the importance of fine-scale heterogeneity in governing large-scale ecosystem function, showing how population and community-level processes influence ecosystem composition and structure, patterns of aboveground carbon accumulation, and net ecosystem production.},

abstract = {In analogy to the species?area relationship (SAR), one of the few laws in ecology, the phylogenetic diversity?area relationship (PDAR) describes the tendency of phylogenetic diversity (PD) to increase with area. Although investigating PDAR has the potential to unravel the underlying processes shaping assemblages across spatial scales and to predict PD loss through habitat reduction, it has been little investigated so far. Focusing on PD has noticeable advantages compared to species richness (SR), since PD also gives insights on processes such as speciation/extinction, assembly rules and ecosystem functioning. Here we investigate the universality and pervasiveness of the PDAR at continental scale using terrestrial mammals as study case. We define the relative robustness of PD (compared to SR) to habitat loss as the area between the standardized PDAR and standardized SAR (i.e., standardized by the diversity of the largest spatial window) divided by the area under the standardized SAR only. This metric quantifies the relative increase of PD robustness compared to SR robustness. We show that PD robustness is higher than SR robustness but that it varies among continents. We further use a null model approach to disentangle the relative effect of phylogenetic tree shape and nonrandom spatial distribution of evolutionary history on the PDAR. We find that, for most spatial scales and for all continents except Eurasia, PDARs are not different from expected by a model using only the observed SAR and the shape of the phylogenetic tree at continental scale. Interestingly, we detect a strong phylogenetic structure of the Eurasian PDAR that can be predicted by a model that specifically account for a finer biogeographical delineation of this continent. In conclusion, the relative robustness of PD to habitat loss compared to species richness is determined by the phylogenetic tree shape but also depends on the spatial structure of PD.},

abstract = {1. Effective weed control is essential in field vegetables. However, the range of available herbicides has been continually reduced for commercial and toxicological reasons over the last decade. In order to predict the optimum weeding period and to apply alternative control strategies successfully, a realistic estimate is needed of the size, timing and duration of a flush of weed emergence in a crop. The soil weed seed bank is the primary source of future weed populations, and therefore provides a unique resource for predictive management purposes. 2. Models have previously been developed to predict the emergence of weed species from different burial depths and to simulate the vertical movement of weed seeds following seed bed preparation. 3. In this investigation a vertical movement model was extended to include the effects of four cultivation implements on the horizontal displacement of weed seeds. These implements were a rotavator, a spring tine, a spader and a power harrow. 4. The rotavator caused a backward movement of seeds; neither the spring tine nor spader had a significant effect on the horizontal displacement of seeds; whilst the power harrow had the greatest capacity to move seeds forward {\textgreater} 0.5 m in the soil. 5. This investigation combined depth of burial and vertical movement models to simulate the likely outcome of different sequences of spring tine, spader, rotavator and power hat-row on subsequent weed seedling emergence. For example, sequences including multiple passes of a spader increased the numbers of emerged seedlings, whilst for those where the rotavator dominated the sequence, a marked reduction in seedling numbers was predicted. The findings of a series of simulations are viewed in the light of existing methods of weed control based on soil cultivation, for example the stale seed bed technique. 6. The combined model provides the basis for a decision support system to aid the control of weeds. Additionally, it provides a research tool to improve understanding of the dynamics of the weed seed bank and the implications of seed bed preparations for future populations. The combined model has helped to identify areas of weed seed ecology requiring further study, essential for the development of true dynamic models.},

abstract = {A climate warming of 2–5°C by the end of the century will impact the likelihood of seed germination of sugar maple ( Acer saccharum ), a dominant tree species which possesses a restricted temperature range to ensure successful reproduction. We hypothesize that seed origin affects germination due to the species' local adaptation to temperature. We tested this by experimentally investigating the effect of incubation temperature and temperature shifting on sugar maple seed germination from seven different seed sources representing the current species range. Survival analysis showed that seeds from the northern range had the highest germination percentage, while the southern range had the lowest. The mean germination percentage under constant temperatures was best when temperatures were ≤5°C, whereas germination percentages plummeted at temperatures ≥11°C (5.8{\%}). Cool shifting increased germination by 19.1{\%} over constant temperature treatments and by 29.3{\%} over warm shifting treatments. Both shifting treatments caused earlier germination relative to the constant temperature treatments. A climate warming of up to +5°C is shown to severely reduce germination of seeds from the southern range. However, under a more pronounced warming of 7°C, seed germination at the northern range become more affected and now comparable to those found from the southern range. This study states that the high seed germination percentage found in sugar maple at the northern range makes it fairly resilient to the warmest projected temperature increase for the next century. These findings provide forest managers with the necessary information to make accurate projections when considering strategies for future regeneration while also considering climate warming.},

abstract = {In addition to habitat loss and fragmentation, agricultural change has led to a change in seed dispersal processes in the rural landscape through a loss of structural and functional connectivity. Here, human-mediated dispersal vectors are prevalent, and we explored whether the loss of connectivity via free-ranging livestock could be mitigated by the increase in roads and motor vehicles. We found that structurally, 39{\%} of all valuable semi-natural grassland habitats in southern Sweden are adjacent to public road verges, which in the rural landscape are often considered to be suitable habitat for grassland species. Additionally, by collecting mud attached to cars and farming machinery and manure from livestock (cattle, horse, sheep) grazing semi-natural grassland pasture, we found that motor vehicles are also capable seed dispersers. A similar number of species were dispersed by both vectors, although the composition of samples was quite different. Motor vehicles dispersed more grassland specialists than invasive species, although in much lower abundances than did grazing livestock. Despite these differences, motor vehicles were found to be able to disperse species with the same kinds of dispersal traits as livestock. A high number of seeds, species and specialists in manure samples means that greater movement of livestock is desirable to increase functional grassland connectivity. However, effective management could improve the suitability of roadsides as grassland corridors and increase the availability of seeds for long-distance human-mediated dispersal via cars and tractors. Our results suggest that in many rural landscapes, connectivity by road networks could help mediate habitat loss and fragmentation of grasslands. However, such effects can be context dependent, and the connectivity provided by roads could have serious negative consequences in other regions.},

abstract = {Gene flow strongly influences the regional genetic structuring of plant populations. Seed and pollen dispersal patterns can respond differently to the increased isolation resulting from habitat fragmentation, with unpredictable consequences for gene flow and population structuring. In a recently fragmented landscape we compared the pre- and post-fragmentation genetic structure of populations of a tree species where pollen and seed dispersal respond differentially to forest fragmentation generated by flooding. Castanopsis sclerophylla is wind-pollinated, with seeds that are dispersed by gravity and rodents. Using microsatellites, we found no significant difference in genetic diversity between pre- and post-fragmentation cohorts. Significant genetic structure was observed in pre-fragmentation cohorts, due to an unknown genetic barrier that had isolated one small population. Among post-fragmentation cohorts this genetic barrier had disappeared and genetic structure was significantly weakened. The strengths of genetic structuring were at a similar level in both cohorts, suggesting that overall gene flow of C. sclerophylla has been unchanged by fragmentation at the regional scale. Fragmentation has blocked seed dispersal among habitats, but this appears to have been compensated for by enhanced pollen dispersal, as indicated by the disappearance of a genetic barrier, probably as a result of increased wind speeds and easier pollen movement over water. Extensive pollen flow can counteract some negative effects of fragmentation and assist the long-term persistence of small remnant populations.},

abstract = {Because of environmental and health safety issues, it is necessary to develop strategies that do not rely on herbicides to manage weeds. Introducing temporary grassland into annual crop rotations and mechanical weeding are the two main features that are frequently used in integrated and organic cropping systems for this purpose. To evaluate the contribution of these two factors in interaction with other cropping system components and environmental conditions, the present study updated an existing biophysical model (i.e. AlomySys) that quantifies the effects of cropping system on weed dynamics. Based on previous experiments, new sub-models were built to describe the effects on plant survival and growth reduction of mechanical weeding resulting from weed seedling uprooting and covering by soil, and those of grassland mowing resulting from tiller destruction. Additional modifications described the effect of the multi-year crop canopy of grassland on weed survival, growth, development and seed return to the soil. The improved model was used to evaluate the weed dynamics over 27 years in the conventional herbicide-based cropping system most frequently observed in farm surveys (i.e. oilseed rape/winter wheat/winter barley rotation with superficial tillage) and then to test prospective non-chemical scenarios. Preliminary simulations tested a large range of mechanical weeding and mowing strategies, varying operation frequencies, dates and, in the case of mechanical weeding, characteristics (i.e. tool, working depth, tractor speed). For mechanical weeding soon after sowing, harrowing was better than hoeing for controlling weed seed production. The later the operation, the more efficient the hoeing and the less efficient the harrowing. Tractor speed had little influence. Increasing tilling depth increased plant mortality but increased weed seed production because of additional seed germination triggering by the weeding tool. Decreasing the interrow width for hoeing was nefarious for weed control. The best combinations were triple hoeing in oilseed rape and sextuple harrowing in cereals. The best mowing strategy was mowing thrice, every 4-6 weeks, starting in mid-May. The best individual options were combined, simulated over 27 years and compared to the herbicide-based reference system. If herbicide applications were replaced solely by mechanical weeding, blackgrass infestation could not be satisfactorily controlled. If a three-year lucerne was introduced into the rotation, weed infestations were divided by ten. Replacing chisel by mouldboard ploughing before winter wheat reduced weed infestations at short, medium and long term to a level comparable to the herbicide-based reference system. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Matrix population models may generate important information to prevent undesirable outcomes for endangered species. This is the case for Araucaria angustifolia, a Critically Endangered conifer, with little knowledge regarding its life history and trends in development over time. This study sought to investigate life-history trends of an A. angustifolia population in a subtropical forest in Santa Catarina, Brazil. Predictions based on the Lozenge regeneration model were established in order to determine if this model could predict changes in the species' population dynamics: (1) the established individuals exhibit long persistence and (2) seedling and sapling abundance, as well as population descriptors, should exhibit behaviour that indicates one of the stages prescribed by the model. All A. angustifolia individuals were evaluated within a 5.1 ha plot at the study site over a six-year period. Lefkovitch's transition model was used and population descriptors were calculated. Both predictions were fulfilled. The population had $\lambda$ = 0.9977 (0.9864 {\textless} $\lambda$ {\textless} 1.0020; CI 95{\%}), indicating a declining stability. The basal area remained stable, whereas tree density tended to decrease, and seedlings and saplings did not promote an increase in $\lambda$. These results indicate that the population was in a phase called thinning, defined by the Lozenge model. The results led to three conclusions: recruitment seems insufficient; survival of reproductive individuals is responsible for the longevity of the population; and the predictions did not refute the Lozenge model. According to this model, the population is expected to regenerate in the future. However, the species exhibits declining stability, which aggravates the endangerment situation.},

abstract = {The metacommunity concept is an important way to think about linkages between different spatial scales in ecology. Here we review current understanding about this concept. We first investigate issues related to its definition as a set of local communities that are linked by dispersal of multiple potentially interacting species. We then identify four paradigms for metacommunities: the patch-dynamic view, the species-sorting view, the mass effects view and the neutral view, that each emphasizes different processes of potential importance in metacommunities. These have somewhat distinct intellectual histories and we discuss elements related to their potential future synthesis. We then use this framework to discuss why the concept is useful in modifying existing ecological thinking and illustrate this with a number of both theoretical and empirical examples. As ecologists strive to understand increasingly complex mechanisms and strive to work across multiple scales of spatio-temporal organization, concepts like the metacommunity can provide important insights that frequently contrast with those that would be obtained with more conventional approaches based on local communities alone.},

abstract = {Distribution shifts of tree species are likely to be highly dependent upon population performance at distribution edges. Understanding the drivers of aspects of performance, such as growth, at distribution edges is thus crucial to accurately predicting responses of tree species to climate change. Here, we use a Bayesian model and sensitivity analysis to partition the effects of climate and crowding, as a metric of competition, on radial growth of three dominant conifer species along montane ecotones in the Rocky Mountains. These ecotones represent upper and lower distribution edges of two species, and span the distribution interior of the third species. Our results indicate a greater influence of climate (i.e., temperature and precipitation) than crowding on radial growth. Competition importance appears to increase towards regions of more favorable growing conditions, and precise responses to crowding and climate vary across species. Overall, our results suggest that climate will likely be the most important determinant of changes in tree growth at distribution edges of these montane conifers in the future.},

abstract = {Tree species are expected to track warming climate by shifting their ranges to higher latitudes or elevations, but cur- rent evidence of latitudinal range shifts for suites of species is largely indirect. In response to global warming, off- spring of trees are predicted to have ranges extend beyond adults at leading edges and the opposite relationship at trailing edges. Large-scale forest inventory data provide an opportunity to compare present latitudes of seedlings and adult trees at their range limits. Using the USDA Forest Service's Forest Inventory and Analysis data, we directly compared seedling and tree 5th and 95th percentile latitudes for 92 species in 30 longitudinal bands for 43 334 plots across the eastern United States. We further compared these latitudes with 20th century temperature and precipita- tion change and functional traits, including seed size and seed spread rate. Results suggest that 58.7{\%} of the tree spe- cies examined show the pattern expected for a population undergoing range contraction, rather than expansion, at both northern and southern boundaries. Fewer species show a pattern consistent with a northward shift (20.7{\%}) and fewer still with a southward shift (16.3{\%}). Only 4.3{\%} are consistent with expansion at both range limits. When com- pared with the 20th century climate changes that have occurred at the range boundaries themselves, there is no con- sistent evidence that population spread is greatest in areas where climate has changed most; nor are patterns related to seed size or dispersal characteristics. The fact that the majority of seedling extreme latitudes are less than those for adult trees may emphasize the lack of evidence for climate-mediated migration, and should increase concerns for the risks posed by climate change.},

abstract = {Phenotypic traits and their associated trade-offs have been shown to have globally consistent effects on individual plant physiological functions1–3, but how these effects scale up to influence competition, a key driver of community assembly in terrestrial vegetation, has remained unclear 4. Here we use growth data from more than 3 million trees in over 140,000 plots across the world to show how three key functional traits—wood density, specific leaf area and maximum height—consistently influence competitive interactions. Fast maximum growth of a species was correlated negatively with its wood density in all biomes, and positively with its specific leaf area in most biomes. Low wood density was also correlated with a low ability to tolerate competition and a low competitive effect on neighbours, while high specific leaf area was correlated with a low competitive effect. Thus, traits generate trade-offs between performance with competition versus performance without competition, a fundamental ingredient in the classical hypothesis that the coexistence of plant species is enabled via differentiation in their successional strategies5. Competition within species was stronger than between species, but an increase in trait dissimilarity between species had little influence in weakening competition. No benefit of dissimilarity was detected for specific leaf area or wood density, and only a weak benefit for maximum height. Our trait- based approach to modelling competition makes generalization possible across the forest ecosystems of the world and their highly diverse species composition.},

abstract = {In order to determine the implications of including planted populations in conservation planning, we investigate the structure and genetic diversity, mating system, and effective population size within families in three planted and one natural Araucaria angustifolia populations. The study area is a Brazilian National Forest in southern Brazil, established in the 1950s. Genetic analysis was investigated using nine allozyme loci. Significant and positive fixation index was detected for the adults of all studied populations. Although we observed lower levels of genetic diversity and biparental inbreeding in some populations, their pattern of mating, similar to that expected in panmixia, indicates that all populations can be used in conservation planning. Furthermore, the presence of unique alleles and the significant genetic differentiation among all adult populations (F ST = 0.404) reinforces that all populations are important conservation resources. The average paternity correlation was high in almost all populations, showing that open-pollinated families are composed of mixtures of half- and full-sibs. With regards to conservation strategies, our results suggest that seed collection from at least 133 seed trees is necessary to retain a reference effective population size of 500. Our results confirm that the planted Araucaria forests in southern Brazil can be useful as a genetic resource for conservation, breeding and reforestation strategies for this threatened species. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {Criticism has been levelled at climate-change-induced forecasts of species range shifts that do not account explicitly for complex population dynamics. The relative importance of such dynamics under climate change is, however, undetermined because direct tests comparing the performance of demographic models vs. simpler ecological niche models are still lacking owing to difficulties in evaluating forecasts using real-world data. We provide the first comparison of the skill of coupled eco- logical-niche-population models and ecological niche models in predicting docu- mented shifts in the ranges of 20 British breeding bird species across a 40-year period. Forecasts from models calibrated with data centred on 1970 were evaluated using data centred on 2010. We found that more complex coupled ecological-niche- population models (that account for dispersal and metapopulation dynamics) tend to have higher predictive accuracy in forecasting species range shifts than structurally simpler models that only account for variation in climate. However, these better forecasts are achieved only if ecological responses to climate change are simulated without static snapshots of historic land use, taken at a single point in time. In con- trast, including both static land use and dynamic climate variables in simpler ecologi- cal niche models improve forecasts of observed range shifts. Despite being less skilful at predicting range changes at the grid-cell level, ecological niche models do as well, or better, than more complex models at predicting the magnitude of relative change in range size. Therefore, ecological niche models can provide a reasonable first approximation of the magnitude of species' potential range shifts, especially when more detailed data are lacking on dispersal dynamics, demographic processes underpinning population performance, and change in land cover.},

The latter method indicates presence of local adaptation even when natives are inferior to introduced populations as long as the negative difference in fitness between the populations is smaller at the native population's home site. The strength of local adaptation was measured as the ratio of the observed to the expected performance in reduced statistical models and regressed on the degree of isolation and population size. We found no evidence of local adaptation in terms of native superiority compared to non-natives, but with the relative method we found one of six fitness components, juvenile survival, to be 6{\%} higher for natives at their home sites compared to how they performed at other sites and how others performed at their site. Further, our results indicate that both isolation and population size have a positive effect on the process of local adaptation.},

Trends in species abundances predicted from meta-analyses and species distribution models will be misleading if they depend on the conditions of individuals. Here we find from a synthesis of tree species in North America that climate-condition interactions dominate responses through two pathways, i) effects of growth that depend on climate, and ii) effects of climate that depend on tree size. Because tree fecundity first increases and then declines with size, climate change that stimulates growth promotes a shift of small trees to more fecund sizes, but the opposite can be true for large sizes. Change the depresses growth also affects fecundity. We find a biogeographic divide, with these interactions reducing fecundity in the West and increasing it in the East. Continental-scale responses of these forests are thus driven largely by indirect effects, recommending management for climate change that considers multiple demographic rates.},

abstract = {Understanding forest complexity and self-organization across multiple scales is essential for both ecology and natural resource management. In this paper, we develop a Markov chain approach for the modelling of forest stand dynamics. The aim of this work is to generalize the recently developed Perfect Plasticity Approximation (PPA) model for scaling of vegetation dynamics from individual level to the landscape level through the ecosystem hierarchical structure. Our basic assumption is that the forested ecosystem and disturbance regimes can be modelled on 3 hierarchical scales (levels): individual trees, forest stand (or patch, defined as a spatial unit about 0.5-1ha of the same forest at one successional stage.) and landscape (collection of forest patches of different forest/soil types at different successional stages) levels. In our modelling approach the PPA model is an intermediate step for scaling from the individual level to the forest stand level (or patch level). In this paper we develop a Markov chain model for stage-structured dynamics of forest stands (patches). In order to determine the structure of the Markov chain model and estimate parameters, we analyze the patch-mosaic patterns of forest stands of the Lake States (MI, WI, and MN) recorded in the USDA FIA database as well as data for other US states and Canada. The distribution of macroscopic characteristics of a large collection of forest patches is considered as an estimate of the stationary distribution of the underlying Markov chain. The data demonstrates that this distribution is unimodal and skewed to the right. We identify the simplest Markov chain that produces such a distribution and estimate the upper bound of the probability of disaster for this Markov chain. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Community ecology aims to understand what factors determine the assembly and dynamics of species assemblages at different spatiotemporal scales. To facilitate the integration between con- ceptual and statistical approaches in community ecology, we propose Hierarchical Modelling of Species Communities (HMSC) as a general, flexible framework for modern analysis of community data. While non-manipulative data allow for only correlative and not causal inference, this frame- work facilitates the formulation of data-driven hypotheses regarding the processes that structure communities. We model environmental filtering by variation and covariation in the responses of individual species to the characteristics of their environment, with potential contingencies on spe- cies traits and phylogenetic relationships. We capture biotic assembly rules by species-to-species association matrices, which may be estimated at multiple spatial or temporal scales. We opera- tionalise the HMSC framework as a hierarchical Bayesian joint species distribution model, and implement it as R- and Matlab-packages which enable computationally efficient analyses of large data sets. Armed with this tool, community ecologists can make sense of many types of data, including spatially explicit data and time-series data. We illustrate the use of this framework through a series of diverse ecological examples.},

abstract = {Assisted migration was proposed several decades ago as a means of addressing the impacts of climate change on species populations. While its risks and benefits have been debated, and suggestions for planning and management given, there is little consensus within the academic literature over whether to adopt it as a policy. We evaluated the main features of the assisted migration literature including the study methods, taxonomic groups, geographic regions and disciplines involved. We further assessed the debate about the use of assisted migration, the main barriers to consensus, and the range of recommendations put forth in the literature for policy, planning or implementation. Commentaries and secondary literature reviews were as prevalent as first-hand scientific research and attention focussed on a global rather than regional level. There was little evidence of knowledge transfer outside of the natural sciences, despite the obvious policy relevance. Scholarly debate on this topic has intensified during the last 3. years. We present a conceptual framework for evaluating arguments in the debate, distinguishing among the direct risks and benefits to species, ecosystems and society on the one hand, and other arguments regarding scientific justification, evidence-base and feasibility on the other. We also identify recommendations with potential to advance the debate, including careful evaluation of risks, benefits and trade-offs, involvement of relevant stakeholders and consideration of the complementarity among assisted migration and less risk-tolerant strategies. We conclude, however, that none of these will solve the fundamental, often values-based, challenges in the debate. Solutions are likely to be complex, context-dependent and multi-faceted, emerging from further research, discussion and experience. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

With increasing information on tropical tree life histories, our predictive understanding is no longer limited by species data but by the ability of existing models to make use of it. Using a demographic forest model, we show that the basal area and compositional changes during forest succession in a neotropical forest can be accurately predicted by representing tropical tree diversity (hundreds of species) with only five functional groups spanning two essential trade-offs—the growth-survival and stature-recruitment trade-offs. This data-driven modeling framework substantially improves our ability to predict consequences of anthropogenic impacts on tropical forests.},

abstract = {Fire-prone landscapes present many challenges for both managers and policy makers in developing adaptive behaviors and institutions. We used a coupled human and natural systems framework and an agent-based landscape model to examine how alternative management scenarios affect fire and ecosystem services metrics in a fire-prone multiownership landscape in the eastern Cascades of Oregon. Our model incorporated existing models of vegetation succession and fire spread and information from original empirical studies of landowner decision making. Our findings indicate that alternative management strategies can have variable effects on landscape outcomes over 50 years for fire, socioeconomic, and ecosystem services metrics. For example, scenarios with federal restoration treatments had slightly less high-severity fire than a scenario without treatment; exposure of homes in the wildland-urban interface to fire was also slightly less with restoration treatments compared to no management. Treatments appeared to be more effective at reducing high-severity fire in years with more fire than in years with less fire. Under the current management scenario, timber production could be maintained for at least 50 years on federal lands. Under an accelerated restoration scenario, timber production fell because of a shortage of areas meeting current stand structure treatment targets. Trade-offs between restoration outcomes (e.g., open forests with large fire-resistant trees) and habitat for species that require dense older forests were evident. For example, the proportional area of nesting habitat for northern spotted owl (Strix occidentalis) was somewhat less after 50 years under the restoration scenarios than under no management. However, the amount of resilient older forest structure and habitat for white-headed woodpecker (Leuconotopicus albolarvatus) was higher after 50 years under active management. More carbon was stored on this landscape without management than with management, despite the occurrence of high-severity wildfire. Our results and further applications of the model could be used in collaborative settings to facilitate discussion and development of policies and practices for fire-prone landscapes. {\textcopyright} 2017 by the author(s).},

abstract = {Understanding how trophic levels respond to changes in abiotic and biotic conditions is key for predicting how food webs will react to environmental perturbations. Different trophic levels may respond disproportionately to change, with lower levels more likely to react faster, as they typically consist of smaller-bodied species with higher reproductive rates. This response could cause a mismatch between trophic levels, in which predators and prey will respond differently to changing abiotic or biotic conditions. This mismatch between trophic levels could result in altered top-down and bottom-up control and changes in interaction strength. To determine the possibility of a mismatch, we conducted a reciprocal-transplant experiment involving Sarracenia purpurea food webs consisting of bacterial communities as prey and a subset of six morphologically similar protozoans as predators. We used a factorial design with four temperatures, four bacteria and protozoan biogeographic origins, replicated four times. This design allowed us to determine how predator and prey dynamics were altered by abiotic (temperature) conditions and biotic (predators paired with prey from either their local or non-local biogeographic origin) conditions. We found that prey reached higher densities in warmer temperature regardless of their temperature of origin. Conversely, predators achieved higher densities in the temperature condition and with the prey from their origin. These results confirm that predators perform better in abiotic and biotic conditions of their origin while their prey do not. This mismatch between trophic levels may be especially significant under climate change, potentially disrupting ecosystem functioning by disproportionately affecting top-down and bottom-up control.},

However, the mechanisms that may be driving such mortality changes and whether particular species are especially vulnerable remain unclear3–8. Here we analyse a 49-year record of tree dynamics from 24 old-growth forest plots encompassing a broad climatic gradient across the Australian moist tropics and find that annual tree mortality risk has, on average, doubled across all plots and species over the last 35 years, indicating a potential halving in life expectancy and carbon residence time. Associated losses in biomass were not offset by gains from growth and recruitment. Plots in less moist local climates presented higher average mortality risk, but local mean climate did not predict the pace of temporal increase in mortality risk. Species varied in the trajectories of their mortality risk, with the highest average risk found nearer to the upper end of the atmospheric vapour pressure deficit niches of species. A long-term increase in vapour pressure deficit was evident across the region, suggesting that thresholds involving atmospheric water stress, driven by global warming, may be a primary cause of increasing tree mortality in moist tropical forests.},

However, this relationship between dispersal distance and seed mass has only been quantified for species from particular sites or with particular dispersal syndromes. 2. We provided the first large-scale, cross-species quantification of the correlations between dispersal distance and both seed mass and plant height. Seed mass was positively related to mean dispersal distance, with a 100-fold increase in seed mass being associated with a 4.5-fold increase in mean dispersal distance (R(2) = 0.16; n = 210 species; P {\textless} 0.001). However, plant height had substantially stronger explanatory power than did seed mass, and we found a 5-fold increase in height was associated with a 4.6-fold increase in mean dispersal distance (R(2) = 0.54; n = 211 species; P {\textless} 0.001). 3. Once plant height was accounted for, we found that small-seeded species dispersed further than did large-seeded species (R(2) = 0.54; n = 181 species; slope = -0.130; P {\textless} 0.001); however, seed mass only added 2{\%} to the R(2) of the model. Within dispersal syndromes, tall species dispersed further than did short species, while seed mass had little influence on dispersal distance. 4. Synthesis.

We present a new approach that overcomes both these limitations. We show how temporal storage effect can be quantified by Monte Carlo simulations in a wide range of models for competing species. We use the lottery model and a generic integral projection model (IPM) to introduce ideas, and present two empirical applications: (1) algal species in a chemostat with variable temperature, showing that the storage effect can operate without a long-lived life stage and (2) a sagebrush steppe community IPM. Our results highlight the need for careful modelling of nonlinearities so that conclusions are not driven by unrecognised model constraints.},

Few attempts have been tried to test May's prediction empirically, and we still ignore what is the actual complexity–stability relationship in natural ecosystems. Here we perform a stability analysis of 116 quantitative food webs sampled worldwide. We find that classic descriptors of complexity (species richness, connectance and interaction strength) are not associated with stability in empirical food webs. Further analysis reveals that a correlation between the effects of predators on prey and those of prey on predators, combined with a high frequency of weak interactions, stabilize food web dynamics relative to the random expectation. We conclude that empirical food webs have several non-random properties contributing to the absence of a complexity–stability relationship.},

Supply limitation, on the other hand, was the primary cause of recruitment failure for two less common species, Abies balsamea (L.) Mill. and Fagus grandifolia Ehrh. The cause of supply limitation was a lack of parent trees, in the case of A. balsamea, and low fecundity, in the case of F. grandifolia. Our results suggest that niche differences (i.e., germination requirements) are more important than dispersal in structuring temperate forest communities. Our results also suggest that availability of suitable substrates is the primary factor limiting seedling recruitment following logging. {\textcopyright} 2005 NRC Canada.},

abstract = {Although theory has demonstrated rather low levels of gene flow are sufficient to counteract opposing mutation, drift, and selection, widespread recognition of the evolutionary importance of gene flow has come slowly. The perceived role of gene flow as an evolutionary force has vacillated over the last century. In the last few decades, new methods and analyses have demonstrated that plant gene flow rates vary tremendously-from nil to very high-depending on the species and specific populations involved, and sometimes over time for individual populations. In many cases, the measured gene flow rates are evolutionarily significant at distances of hundreds and sometimes thousands of meters, occurring at levels sufficient to counteract drift, spread advantageous alleles, or thwart moderate levels of opposing local selection. Gene flow in plants is likely to often act as a cohesive force, uniting individual plant species into real evolutionary units. Also, gene flow can evolve under natural selection, decreasing or increasing. The fact of frequent, but variable, plant gene flow has important consequences for applied issues in which the presence or absence of gene flow might influence the outcome of a policy, regulatory, or management decision. Examples include the unintended spread of engineered genes, the evolution of invasiveness, and conservation. New data-rich genomic techniques allow closer scrutiny of the role of gene flow in plant evolution. Most plant evolutionists now recognize the importance of gene flow, and it is receiving increased recognition from other areas of plant biology as well. {\textcopyright} 2014 Botanical Society of America.},

abstract = {1. Ecological and evolutionary research increasingly uses quantitative synthesis of primary research studies (meta-analysis) for answering fundamental questions, informing environmental policy and summarizing results for decision makers. 2. Knowing how meta-analysis works is important for researchers so that their research can have broader impact. Meta-analytic thinking encourages scientists to see single primary research studies as substantial contri-butions to a larger picture. 3. To facilitate inclusion in a meta-analysis, relevant primary research studies must be found and basic informa-tion about the methods and results must be thoroughly, clearly and transparently reported. While many pub-lished papers provide this information, it is common for essential data to be omitted, leading to study exclusion from meta-analyses. 4. We provide guidelines for correctly reporting basic data needed from primary studies in ecology and evolu-tionary biology so that they can be included in meta-analyses, together with examples that show how data should be reported to enable calculation and analysis of effect sizes, and how data should be made accessible. 5. These guidelines are important for reporting research results in general, whether or not results are included in subsequent meta-analyses, because they are necessary for the interpretation and assessment of study outcomes. Increased implementation of these guidelines by authors, editors and publishers, and reinforcement by funders, will foster higher quality and more inclusive syntheses, further the goals of transparency and reproducibility in science, and improve the quality and value of primary research studies.},

abstract = {The logging of large trees in tropical forests causes a decrease in the density of reproductive individ- uals, which likely affects the pattern of pollen dispersal and the mating system of the remaining trees in the pop- ulation. Here, we investigate the impact of logging on mating system and genetic diversity of the low-density, thrip-pollinated, dioecious tree Bagassa guianensis with- in a 500-ha plot at Tapaj{\'{o}}s National Forest, Par{\'{a}} State, Brazil. Mating system parameters of the logged popula- tion were estimated using mixed-mating model. Six mi- crosatellite loci were used to genotype 232 seeds from ten remnant female trees over three seasons (2006, 2007, and 2008). The data were compared with the mating system of the unlogged population of B. guianensis (18 female trees, 488 seeds) in the same plot. The overall number of alleles found in the open-pollinated progenies decreased after logging (K=71 before logging and K=57 after logging, considering the three after logging seasons pooled), as well as the average number of alleles per locus (A = 11.8 and 9.5, respectively). Similarly, the number of private alleles, which is defined in the context of this study as the number of alleles observed in the population exclusively before or after logging, also de- creased after logging (15 and 1, respectively). However, the average number of alleles per locus and the observed and expected heterozygosities were not significantly higher before logging than after logging. Logging Logging also did not affect the inbreeding of progenies in the popula- tion. Somewhat unexpectedly, the effective number of pollen donors was consistently higher after (Nep =14.5 in 2006, 8.1 in 2007, and 6.3 in 2008) than before log- ging (Nep = 3.4), suggesting that the loss of alleles in the population was compensated by the higher heterogeneity in the pollen pool after the removal of the largest trees by logging. Potential causes explaining the patterns found here include the maintenance of large patches of forest around the logged plot and the species' ability to perform long-distance pollination by airborne thrips. Maintenance of landscape integrity as logged and unlogged forests around the exploited areas is recom- mended to enhance pollen migration and to avoid long- term losses in genetic diversity},

@article{Tilman1994,
abstract = {All organisms, esecially terrestrial plants and other sessile species, interact mainly with their neighbors, but neighborhoods can differ in composition because of dispersal and mortality. There is increasingly strong evidence that the spatial structure created by these forces profoundly influences the dynamics, composition, and biodiversity of communities. Nonspatial models predict that no more consumer species can coexist at equilibrium than there are limiting resources. In contrast, a similar model that includes neighborhood competition and random dispersal among sites predicts stable coexistence of a potentially unlimited number of species on a single resource. Coexistence cocurs because species with sufficiently high dispersal rates persist in sites not occupied by surperior competitors. Coexistence requires limiting similarity and two-way or three-way interspecific trade-offs among competitive ability, colonization ability and longevity. This spatial competition hypothesis seems to explain the coexistence of the numerous plant species that compete for a single limiting resource in the grasslands of Cedar Creek Natural History Area. It provides a testable, alternative explanation for other high diversity communities, such as tropical forests. The model can be tested (1) by determining if coexisting species have the requisite trade-offs in colonization, competition, and longevity, (2) by addition of propagules to determine if local species abundances are limited by dispersal, and (3) by comparisons of the effects on biodiversity of high rates of propagule addition for species that differ in competitive ability.},

abstract = {Ecology Letters (2011) 14: 828–839 Abstract The contribution of deterministic and stochastic processes to species coexistence is widely debated. With the introduction of powerful statistical techniques, we can now better characterise different sources of uncertainty when quantifying niche differentiation. The theoretical literature on the effect of stochasticity on coexistence, however, is often ignored by field ecologists because of its technical nature and difficulties in its application. In this review, we examine how different sources of variability in population dynamics contribute to coexistence. Unfortunately, few general rules emerge among the different models that have been studied to date. Nonetheless, we believe that a greater understanding is possible, based on the integration of coexistence and population extinction risk theories. There are two conditions for coexistence in the presence of environmental and demographic variability: (1) the average per capita growth rates of all coexisting species must be positive when at low densities, and (2) these growth rates must be strong enough to overcome negative random events potentially pushing densities to extinction. We propose that critical tests for species coexistence must account for niche differentiation arising from this variability and should be based explicitly on notions of stability and ecological drift.},

Using a spatially explicit metapopulation model, this paper examines the likely consequences for the survival of species of different scenarios of forest management and conservation. The results point to the conclusion that it generally pays to concentrate the efforts of improving forest quality at certain areas rather than to spread the same total effort evenly and therefore thinly throughout the entire forest landscape. The practical conclusion is that in southern Finland an extensive restoration program of managed forests to natural-like successional forests is needed to avert the imminent wave of extinctions of specialist forest species. The greatest positive effect is obtained if forests located close to the existing remnants of biologically diverse forests are restored, which would facilitate the migration of target species to the restored forests},

Since little effort has been made towards conservation of these resources, the assessment and the integration of information and knowledge so far generated are valuable tools in order to promote their conservation. In the present work the Brazilian conifer Araucaria angustifolia was used as a case study, integrating information, published between 1980 and 2007, about genetics, biotechnology, palaeobotany, and archeology. These studies were interpreted towards the conservation needs and strategies of the species germplasm. The main conclusions for the conservation of A. angustifolia genetic resources are: (1) despite the reduction of genetic diversity by unsustainable forest exploitation, the genetic system of A. angustifolia seems to be efficient to protect this species against rapid losses of its genetic diversity; (2) conservation measures starting now may be efficient, since the genetic structures of existing populations is more largely influenced by the past evolutionary process than by human disturbance occurred in the last century; (3) there are opportunities to save the genetic resources of the species, if simple measures are taken to safeguard the continued existence of the few remaining araucaria forests. Emerged as a general conclusion that the use of sound scientific arguments supported by different areas of the science could be a very powerful instrument in persuading decision-makers, also by governments, taking into account forest genetic resources as a primary issue for the future. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.},

Hybridization can occur between canola and its wild relative, wild radish. We studied the effects of wild radish plant density and date of emergence, canola (glyphosate resistant) planting dates, presence of other weeds, and presence of a wheat crop on the synchrony of flowering between wild radish and canola (as a crop and volunteer). Four field experiments were conducted from 2000 to 2002 in St-David de Levis, Quebec. Flowering periods of wild radish emerging after glyphosate application overlapped with early-, intermediate-, and late-seeded canola 14, 26, and 55{\%}, respectively, of the total flowering time. Flowering periods of early-emerging wild radish and canola volunteers in uncropped treatments overlapped from mid-June until the end of July, ranging from 26 to 81{\%} of the total flowering time. Flowering periods of wild radish and canola volunteers emerging synchronously on May 30 or June 5 as weeds in wheat overlapped 88 and 42{\%}, respectively, of their total flowering time. For later emergence dates, few flowers or seeds were produced by both species because of wheat competition. Wild radish density in canola and wild radish and canola volunteer densities in wheat did not affect the mean flowering dates of wild radish or canola. Increasing wild radish density in uncropped plots (pure or weedy stands) hastened wild radish flowering. Our results show that if hybridization is to happen, it will be most likely with uncontrolled early-emerging weeds in crops or on roadsides, field margins, and uncultivated areas, stressing the need to control the early flush of weeds, weedy relatives, and crop volunteers in noncrop areas.},

abstract = {Resilience is a component of ecological stability; it is assessed as the rate at which perturbations to a stable ecological system decay. The most frequently used estimate of resilience is based on the eigenvalues of the system at its equilibrium. In most cases, this estimate describes the rate of recovery only asymptotically, as time goes to infinity. However, in the short term, perturbations can grow significantly before they decay, and eigenvalues provide no information about this transient behavior. We present several new measures of transient response that complement resilience as a description of the response to perturbation. These indices measure the extent and duration of transient growth in models with asymptotically stable equilibria. They are the reactivity (the maximum possible growth rate immediately following the perturbation), the maximum amplification (the largest proportional deviation that can be produced by any perturbation), and the time at which this amplification occurs. We demonstrate the calculation of these indices using previously published linear compartment models (two models for phosphorus cycling through a lake ecosystem and one for the flow of elements through a tropical rain forest) and a standard nonlinear predator-prey model. Each of these models exhibits transient growth of perturbations, despite asymptotic stability. Measures of relative stability that ignore transient growth will often give a misleading picture of the response to a perturbation.},

We propose an integrative framework linking ecological theory, empirical data and statistical models to understand the distribution of species and their abundances together with the underlying community assembly dynamics. We illustrate our approach with 21 plant species in the French Alps. We show that a spatially nested modelling framework significantly improves the model's performance and that the spatial variations of species presence-absence and abundances are predominantly explained by different factors. We also show that incorporating abiotic, dispersal and biotic factors into the same model bring new insights to our understanding of community assembly. This approach, at the crossroads between community ecology and biogeography, is a promising avenue for a better understanding of species co-existence and biodiversity distribution. {\textcopyright} 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

A change in a climate variable may alter a species abundance not only through a direct effect on that species vital rates, but also through indirect effects mediated by species interactions. While recent work has highlighted cases in which indirect effects overwhelm the direct effects of climate, we lack robust generalizations to predict the strength of indirect effects. 2. For communities dominated by non-trophic interactions, we propose that the potential for indirect effects of climate change declines with the strength of stabilizing niche differences. 3. We tested this hypothesis by analysing an empirically parameterized four species population model. We quantified negative frequency dependence in population growth rates as a measure of stabilizing niche differences and projected the sensitivity of each species to direct and indirect effects of climate perturbations. 4. Consistent with our hypothesis, species' sensitivities to indirect effects decreased rapidly with increasing stabilization by niche differences. 5. Synthesis. Information about niche differences can identify species sensitive to indirect effects of climate change and determine when multispecies forecasting approaches are necessary. However, practical application of this generalization will require methods to predict niche differences from easily collected data.},

abstract = {The phylogeographical history of mid-altitude woodland herbs that depend on moist and shaded forest habitats is poorly understood. Here, we analysed the genetic structure of Cyclamen purpurascens, a mountainous calcicolous perennial, to test hypotheses regarding its glacial survival in single or multiple refugia and postglacial colonization routes, and to explore how they are congruent with the histories inferred for temperate trees and other mountainous herbs. We gathered AFLP data and chloroplast DNA sequences (trnD-trnT region) from 68 populations spanning the entire distribution range (the Jura Mountains, Alps, western Carpathians, Dinarides). Both genetic markers revealed two main phylogeographical groups (phylogroups) in C. purpurascens. Additionally, AFLP data detected a more detailed structure of five phylogroups: two widespread, showing east−west geographical separation, and three local ones, restricted to somewhat disjunct, marginal regions of the species range. We suggest that C. purpurascens survived the last glaciation in two main regions, the foothills of the Southern Limestone Alps and the Karst area of the north-western Dinarides, and possibly also in microrefugia in the Western Carpathians. The glacial persistence and colonization routes of this woodland herb are highly concordant with those inferred for several temperate trees, especially the European beech. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2012, 105, 741–760.},

abstract = {* Current global changes make it important to be able to predict which interactions will occur in the emerging ecosystems. Most of the current methods to infer the existence of interactions between two species require a good knowledge of their behaviour or a direct observation of interactions. In this paper, we overcome these limitations by developing a method, inspired from the niche model of food web structure, using the statistical relationship between predator and prey body size to infer the matrix of potential interactions among a pool of species. * The novelty of our approach is to infer, for any species of a given species pool, the three species-specific parameters of the niche model. The method applies to both local and metaweb scales. It allows one to evaluate the feeding interactions of a new species entering the community. * We find that this method gives robust predictions of the structure of food webs and that its efficiency is increased when the strength of the body–size relationship between predators and preys increases. * We finally illustrate the potential of the method to infer the metaweb structure of pelagic fishes of the Mediterranean sea under different global change scenarios.},

abstract = {In theoretical studies, the most commonly used measure of ecological stability is resilience: ecosystems asymptotic rate of return to equilibrium after a pulse-perturbation -or shock. A complementary notion of growing popularity is reactivity: the strongest initial response to shocks. On the other hand, empirical stability is often quantified as the inverse of temporal variability, directly estimated on data, and reflecting ecosystems response to persistent and erratic environmental disturbances. It is unclear whether and how this empirical measure is related to resilience and reactivity. Here, we establish a connection by introducing two variability-based stability measures belonging to the theoretical realm of resilience and reactivity. We call them intrinsic, stochastic and deterministic invariability; respectively defined as the inverse of the strongest stationary response to white-noise and to single-frequency perturbations. We prove that they predict ecosystems worst response to broad classes of disturbances, including realistic models of environmental fluctuations. We show that they are intermediate measures between resilience and reactivity and that, although defined with respect to persistent perturbations, they can be related to the whole transient regime following a shock, making them more integrative notions than reactivity and resilience. We argue that invariability measures constitute a stepping stone, and discuss the challenges ahead to further unify theoretical and empirical approaches to stability.},

@article{Drever2006,
abstract = {Given the increasingly global stresses on forests, many ecologists argue that managers must maintain ecolog- ical resilience: the capacity of ecosystems to absorb disturbances without undergoing fundamental change. In this re- view we ask: Can the emerging paradigm of natural-disturbance-based management (NDBM) maintain ecological resilience in managed forests? Applying resilience theory requires careful articulation of the ecosystem state under con- sideration, the disturbances and stresses that affect the persistence of possible alternative states, and the spatial and temporal scales of management relevance. Implementing NDBM while maintaining resilience means recognizing that (i) biodiversity is important for long-term ecosystem persistence, (ii) natural disturbances play a critical role as a gener- ator of structural and compositional heterogeneity at multiple scales, and (iii) traditional management tends to produce forests more homogeneous than those disturbed naturally and increases the likelihood of unexpected catastrophic change by constraining variation of key environmental processes. NDBM may maintain resilience if silvicultural strate- gies retain the structures and processes that perpetuate desired states while reducing those that enhance resilience of undesirable states. Such strategies require an understanding of harvesting impacts on slow ecosystem processes, such as seed-bank or nutrient dynamics, which in the long term can lead to ecological surprises by altering the forest's capacity to reorganize after disturbance.},

abstract = {Changes in local population size are expected to have an effect on the degree of genetic microdifferentiation. A decrease in population size is expected to lead to an increase in microdifferentiation, and an increase in population size to a decrease in microdifferentiation. These expectations are routinely used with historical and/or demographic data to evaluate changes in estimates of microdifferentiation obtained over time for human populations. Here I look more closely at these expectations by using simple mathematical models that relate a change in average effective population size to the degree of microdifferentiation. The direction of change in microdifferentiation is influenced by the migration structure of the populations and the proximity of the region to an equilibrium state. A change in population size always leads to a new equilibrium, but the speed at which this new equilibrium is reached depends on migration and time depth. A decline in population size in one generation always leads to an immediate increase in the degree of microdifferentiation. An increase in population size in one generation could lead to an initial decrease or increase in the degree of microdifferentiation or to no change at all. Consideration of the parameters of the models shows under what conditions such changes occur. The relevance of these models is explored using summary data from a number of human populations.},

abstract = {Variation in life-history strategies can affect metapopulation dynamics and consequently the composition and diversity of communities. However, data sets that allow for the full range of species turnover from colonization to extinction over relevant time periods are limited. The late Quaternary record provides unique opportunities to explore the traits that may have influenced interspecific variation in responses to past climate warming, in particular the rate at which species colonized newly suitable habitat or went locally extinct from degrading habitat. We controlled for differences in species climate niches in order to predict expected colonization and extinction sequences recorded in packrat middens from 15 localities in the Mohave, Sonoran, and Chihuahuan deserts of North America. After accounting for temperature niche differences, we tested the hypotheses that dispersal syndrome (none, wind, vertebrate), growth form (herb, shrub, tree) and seed mass mediated variation in postglacial colonization lags among species, whereas clonality (clonal, non-clonal), growth form, and seed mass affected extinction lags. Growth form and dispersal syndrome interactively affected colonization lags, where herbaceous species lacking long-distance dispersal mechanisms exhibited lags that exceeded those of woody, wind or vertebrate-dispersed species by an average of 2,000–5,000 yr. Growth form and seed mass interactively affected extinction lags, with very small-seeded shrubs persisting for 4,000–8,000 yr longer than other functional groups. Taller, vertebrate-dispersed plants have been shown in other studies to disperse farther than shorter plants without specialized dispersal mechanisms. We found that variation along this axis of dispersal syndromes resulted in dramatic differences in colonization rates in response to past climate change. Very small seeded shrubs may have a unique combination of long vegetative and seed bank lifetimes that may allow them to persist for long periods despite declines in habitat condition. This study indicates that readily measurable traits may help predict which species will be more or less sensitive to future climate change, and inform interventions that can stabilize and promote at-risk populations.},

abstract = {A central current debate in community ecology concerns the relative importance of deterministic versus stochastic processes underlying community structure. However, the concept of stochasticity presents several profound philosophical, theoretical and empirical challenges, which we address here. The philosophical argument that nothing in nature is truly stochastic can be met with the following operational concept of neutral stochasticity in community ecology: change in the composition of a community (i.e. community dynamics) is neutrally stochastic to the degree that individual demographic events – birth, death, immigration, emigration – which cause such changes occur at random with respect to species identities. Empirical methods for identifying the stochastic component of community dynamics or structure include null models and multivariate statistics on observational species‐by‐site data (with or without environmental or trait data), and experimental manipulations of ‘stochastic' species colonization order or relative densities and frequencies of competing species. We identify the fundamental limitations of each method with respect to its ability to allow inferences about stochastic community processes. Critical future needs include greater precision in articulating the link between results and ecological inferences, a comprehensive theoretical assessment of the interpretation of statistical analyses of observational data, and experiments focusing on community size and on natural variation in species colonization order.   Synthesis  Community structure and dynamics have often been described as being underlain by ‘stochastic' or ‘neutral' processes, but there is great confusion as to what exactly this means. We attempt to provide conceptual clarity by specifying precisely what focal ecological variable (e.g. species distributions, community composition, demography) is considered to be stochastic with respect to what other variables (e.g. other species' distributions, traits, environment) when using different empirical methods. We clarify what inferences can be drawn by different observational and experimental approaches, and we suggest future avenues of research to better understand the role of neutral stochasticity in community ecology.  },

In this review, we first focus on how dispersal influences the ‘seedscape', or the combination of abiotic and biotic factors that affect the probability of recruitment once a seed has reached its final location. We review recent papers that examine the effect of different dispersal vectors on (1) the quality of the habitat in which a seed lands; (2) the distance seeds are dispersed from the parent tree; and (3) the density and composition of plants within the neighborhood of a seed following deposition. Next, we explore methods used to scale these processes up to the level of populations. We highlight demographic models that integrate across multiple life history stages and predict the impact of dispersal in variable environments on population growth. We also review studies that analyze existing spatial patterns of trees within large forest plots and use various strategies to infer the processes that led to those patterns. We continue to scale up from populations to communities, and discuss approaches that have been taken to understand how dispersal may affect diversity and abundance in the community. We then turn to human disturbances and discuss the implications of frugivore defaunation for plant communities.

abstract = {Understanding the processes maintaining species diversity is a central problem in ecology, with implications for the conservation and management of ecosystems. Although biologists often assume that trait differences between competitors promote diversity, empirical evidence connecting functional traits to the niche differences that stabilize species coexistence is rare. Obtaining such evidence is critical because traits also underlie the average fitness differences driving competitive exclusion, and this complicates efforts to infer community dynamics from phenotypic patterns. We coupled field-parameterized mathematical models of competition between 102 pairs of annual plants with detailed sampling of leaf, seed, root, and whole-plant functional traits to relate phenotypic differences to stabilizing niche and average fitness differences. Single functional traits were often well correlated with average fitness differences between species, indicating that competitive dominance was associated with late phenology, deep rooting, and several other traits. In contrast, single functional traits were poorly correlated with the stabilizing niche differences that promote coexistence. Niche differences could only be described by combinations of traits, corresponding to differentiation between species in multiple ecological dimensions. In addition, several traits were associated with both fitness differences and stabilizing niche differences. These complex relationships between phenotypic differences and the dynamics of competing species argue against the simple use of single functional traits to infer community assembly processes but lay the groundwork for a theoretically justified trait-based community ecology.},

abstract = {Temperate tree species are expected to expand their distribution into the boreal forest in response to climate change. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that many species will experience significant setbacks in capacity to migrate due to a series of unfavourable conditions impacting their recruitment success, and thus their ability to colonize new locations. We quantify the relative influence of a series of factors important for tree seedling recruitment at range margins: propagule dispersal, substrate favourability and the influence of the local hetero-specific species canopy composition. We hypothesized that boreal trees are responsible for priority effects that influence the establishment of temperate tree species seedlings. To do so, we analysed two recruitment stages (first-year seedlings and older seedlings) for seven tree species: Abies balsamea (ABBA), Acer rubrum (ACRU), Acer saccharum (ACSA), Betula papyrifera (BEPA), Betula alleghaniensis (BEAL), Populus tremuloides (POTR) and Fagus grandifolia (FAGR) commonly found within the temperate-boreal ecotone forests of northeastern North America. Overall, we found that boreal canopy trees influence the distribution of substrates, more specifically the occurrence of needle cover and decayed wood in recruitment plots. Interestingly, decayed wood was a poor substrate in almost all cases. This association between canopy and substrate led to highly unfavourable substrates that affected the seedling densities of all temperate tree species. In addition, we found that seedling dispersion was highly localized, where the mean dispersal distance of all trees occurred in close proximity of parent trees. Synthesis. Unfavourable substrates and limited mean dispersal distance of trees due to resident boreal trees generate (strong) priority effects within the temperate-boreal ecotone. Together, these conditions promise to cause significant lags in temperate tree species migration into the boreal forest in the future.},

abstract = {Ecology Letters (2011) ABSTRACT: Empirical models are central to effective conservation and population management, and should be predictive of real-world dynamics. Available modelling methods are diverse, but analysis usually focuses on long-term dynamics that are unable to describe the complicated short-term time series that can arise even from simple models following ecological disturbances or perturbations. Recent interest in such transient dynamics has led to diverse methodologies for their quantification in density-independent, time-invariant population projection matrix (PPM) models, but the fragmented nature of this literature has stifled the widespread analysis of transients. We review the literature on transient analyses of linear PPM models and synthesise a coherent framework. We promote the use of standardised indices, and categorise indices according to their focus on either convergence times or transient population density, and on either transient bounds or case-specific transient dynamics. We use a large database of empirical PPM models to explore relationships between indices of transient dynamics. This analysis promotes the use of population inertia as a simple, versatile and informative predictor of transient population density, but criticises the utility of established indices of convergence times. Our findings should guide further development of analyses of transient population dynamics using PPMs or other empirical modelling techniques.},

abstract = {Matrix projection models occupy a central role in population and conservation biology. Matrix models divide a population into discrete classes, even if the structuring trait exhibits continuous variation (e.g., body size). The integral projection model (IPM) avoids discrete classes and potential artifacts from arbitrary class divisions, facilitates parsimonious modeling based on smooth relationships between individual state and demographic performance, and can be implemented with standard matrix software. Here, we extend the IPM to species with complex demographic attributes, including dormant and active life stages, cross-classification by several attributes (e.g., size, age, and condition), and changes between discrete and continuous structure over the life cycle. We present a general model encompassing these cases, numerical methods, and theoretical results, including stable population growth and sensitivity/elasticity analysis for density-independent models, local stability analysis in density-dependent models, and optimal/evolutionarily stable strategy life-history analysis. Our presentation centers on an IPM for the thistle Onopordum illyricum based on a 6-year field study. Flowering and death probabilities are size and age dependent, and individuals also vary in a latent attribute affecting survival, but a predictively accurate IPM is completely parameterized by fitting a few regression equations.

The bivariate probability distribution of pollen receipt by flowers at the same height as the pollen source is derived. Gravity, vertical random movements, and vegetation density turn out to have similar effects on this distribution. Maximum likelihood methods for estimating the combined parameters from data with multiple point or continuous pollen sources, and one or more plant varieties, are developed. Using an example data set from the literature, it is shown that our model gives a better fit than more traditional descriptive dispersal models of the form e-ar b. We also show that estimates of important properties of the dispersal distribution, such as the variances, become considerably smaller using our model than for the more traditional models. Finally, we discuss potential extensions and evolutionary implications of these types of models. Copyright 1997 Academic Press},

abstract = {Species coexistence in diverse communities likely results from multiple interacting factors. Mechanisms such as conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD) and varying life-history strategies related to resource partitioning are known to influence plant fitness, and thereby community composition and diversity. However, we have little understanding of how these mechanisms interact and how they vary across life stages. Here, we document the interaction between CNDD and life-history strategy, based on growth-mortality trade-offs, from seedling to adult tree for 47 species in a tropical forest. Species' life-history strategies remained consistent across stages: fast-growing species had higher mortality than slow-growing species at all stages. In contrast, mean CNDD was strongest at early life stages (i.e. seedling, sapling). Fast-growing species tended to suffer greater CNDD than slow-growing species at several, but not all life stages. Overall, our results demonstrate that coexistence mechanisms interact across multiple life stages to shape diverse tree communities. },

abstract = {A fundamental goal of ecology is to understand the determinants of species' distributions (i.e., the set of locations where a species is present). Competition among species (i.e., interactions among species that harms each of the species involved) is common in nature and it would be tremendously useful to quantify its effects on species' distributions. An approach to studying the large-scale effects of competition or other biotic interactions is to fit species' distributions models (SDMs) and assess the effect of competitors on the distribution and abundance of the species of interest. It is often difficult to validate the accuracy of this approach with available data. Here, we simulate virtual species that experience competition. In these simulated datasets, we can unambiguously identify the effects that competition has on a species' distribution. We then fit SDMs to the simulated datasets and test whether we can use the outputs of the SDMs to infer the true effect of competition in each simulated dataset. In our simulations, the abiotic environment influenced the effects of competition. Thus, our SDMs often inferred that the abiotic environment was a strong predictor of species abundance, even when the species' distribution was strongly affected by competition. The severity of this problem depended on whether the competitor excluded the focal species from highly suitable sites or marginally suitable sites. Our results highlight how correlations between biotic interactions and the abiotic environment make it difficult to infer the effects of competition using SDMs.},

Since interactions are crucial to the structure and functioning of ecological communities, we need to develop a better understanding of their spatial dynamics. Here, we apply novel numerical tools to data on species interactions, and reveal that they vary more, and in response to different climate variables, than species do. LOCATION: Eurasia. METHODS: We used a measure of Locality Contribution to Beta-Diversity to evaluate the compositional uniqueness of 51 host--parasite communities across Eurasia, using publicly available data. We measured uniqueness based on the species composition, and based on potential and realized biotic interactions. RESULTS: We show that interactions vary more, over space, than species do. In particular, we show that interactions respond to some climatic variables that have no effect on species distribution or dissimilarity. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Species interactions provide far more resolution than species occurrences alone, while still retaining all information about species occurrences. We suggest that they be put front and center in analyses of communities, especially in a biogeographic context.},

At local scales, the distribution of many species is influenced by the interplay of the three factors of habitat availability, local extinctions and colonization dynamics. We use the standard Levins metapopulation model to illustrate how gradients in these three factors can generate species' range limits. We suggest that the three routes to range limits have radically different evolutionary implications. Because the Levins model makes simplifying assumptions about the spatial coupling of local populations, we present numerical studies of spatially explicit metapopulation models that complement the analytical model. The three routes to range limits give rise to distinct spatiotemporal patterns. Range limits in one species can also arise because of environmental gradients impinging upon other species. We briefly discuss a predator–prey example, which illustrates indirect routes to range limits in a metacommunity context.},

abstract = {Drought-induced, regional-scale dieback of forests has emerged as a global concern that is expected to escalate under model projections of climate change. Since 2000, drought of unusual severity, extent, and duration has affected large areas of western North America, leading to regional-scale dieback of forests in the southwestern US. We report on drought impacts on forests in a region farther north, encompassing the transition between boreal forest and prairie in western Canada. A central question is the significance of drought as an agent of large-scale tree mortality and its potential future impact on carbon cycling in this cold region. We used a combination of plot-based, meteorological, and remote sensing measures to map and quantify aboveground, dead biomass of trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) across an 11.5 Mha survey area where drought was exceptionally severe during 2001–2002. Within this area, a satellite-based land cover map showed that aspen-dominated broadleaf forests occupied 2.3 Mha. Aerial surveys revealed extensive patches of severe mortality ({\textgreater}55{\%}) resembling the impacts of fire. Dead aboveground biomass was estimated at 45 Mt, representing 20{\%} of the total aboveground biomass, based on a spatial interpolation of plot-based measurements. Spatial variation in percentage dead biomass showed a moderately strong correlation with drought severity. In the prairie-like, southern half of the study area where the drought was most severe, 35{\%} of aspen biomass was dead, compared with an estimated 7{\%} dead biomass in the absence of drought. Drought led to an estimated 29 Mt increase in dead biomass across the survey area, corresponding to 14 Mt of potential future carbon emissions following decomposition. Many recent, comparable episodes of drought-induced forest dieback have been reported from around the world, which points to an emerging need for multiscale monitoring approaches to quantify drought effects on woody biomass and carbon cycling across large areas.},

abstract = {Aim To define biome-scale hotspots of phylogenetic and functional mammalian biodiversity (PD and FD, respectively) and compare them with ‘classical' hotspots based on species richness (SR) alone. Location Global. Methods SR, PD and FD were computed for 782 terrestrial ecoregions using the distribution ranges of 4616 mammalian species. We used a set of comprehensive diversity indices unified by a recent framework incorporating the relative species coverage in each ecoregion. We built large-scale multifaceted diversity–area relationships to rank ecoregions according to their levels of biodiversity while accounting for the effect of area on each facet of diversity. Finally we defined hotspots as the top-ranked ecoregions. Results While ignoring relative species coverage led to a fairly good congruence between biome-scale top ranked SR, PD and FD hotspots, ecoregions harbouring a rich and abundantly represented evolutionary history and FD did not match with the top-ranked ecoregions defined by SR. More importantly PD and FD hotspots showed important spatial mismatches. We also found that FD and PD generally reached their maximum values faster than SR as a function of area. Main conclusions The fact that PD/FD reach their maximum value faster than SR could suggest that the two former facets might be less vulnerable to habitat loss than the latter. While this point is expected, it is the first time that it has been quantified at a global scale and should have important consequences for conservation. Incorporating relative species coverage into the delineation of multifaceted hotspots of diversity led to weak congruence between SR, PD and FD hotspots. This means that maximizing species number may fail to preserve those nodes (in the phylogenetic or functional tree) that are relatively abundant in the ecoregion. As a consequence it may be of prime importance to adopt a multifaceted biodiversity perspective to inform conservation strategies at a global scale.},

These models must be able to rank candidate cropping systems as a function of pest frequency and severity, and to account for variability in effects to estimate the risk of success or failure of a particular system. Two contrasting approaches are possible. Mechanistic mod- els describe variability with process-based, usually deterministic sub-models quantifying interactions between cropping system components and environmental conditions. Empirical models directly relate observations to input variables, using few parameters, and usually quantify variability with probabilis- tic (stochastic) functions.

Using amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLP) fingerprint data, we investigated the genetic structure within and among populations of G. bohemica in Bavaria, the Czech Republic, and the Austrian border region. The aim of our study was (1) to analyze the genetic structure among populations and to discuss these findings in the context of present and historical patterns of connectivity and isolation of populations, (2) to analyze genetic structure among consecutive generations (cohorts of two consecutive years), and (3) to investigate relationships between intrapopulational diversity and effective population size (N(e)) as well as plant traits. (1) The German populations were strongly isolated from each other (pairwise F(ST)= 0.29-0.60) and from all other populations (F(ST)= 0.24-0.49). We found a pattern of near panmixis among the latter (F(ST)= 0.15-0.35) with geographical distance explaining only 8{\%} of the genetic variance. These results were congruent with a principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) and analysis using STRUCTURE to identify genetically coherent groups. These findings are in line with the strong physical barrier and historical constraints, resulting in separation of the German populations from the others. (2) We found pronounced genetic differences between consecutive cohorts of the German populations (pairwise F(ST)= 0.23 and 0.31), which can be explained by local population history (land use, disturbance). (3) Genetic diversity within populations (Shannon index, H(Sh)) was significantly correlated with N(e) (R(S)= 0.733) and reflected a loss of diversity due to several demographic bottlenecks. Overall, we found that the genetic structure in G. bohemica is strongly influenced by historical periods of high connectivity and isolation as well as by marked demographic fluctuations in declining populations.},

abstract = {We present a theory extending the source-sink concept with an ecosystem perspective. We analyze a model for meta-ecosystem dynamics in a heterogeneous environment to study how the spatial flows of materials such as inorganic nutrients and nutrients sequestered into producers, herbivores, and detritus affect the community dynamics. We show that spatial flows of an inorganic nutrient (direct nutrient flow) and organic matter (indirect nutrient flow) through detritus, producer, or herbivore compartments can reverse the source-sink dynamics of a local ecosystem. More precisely, the balance between such direct and indirect nutrient flows determines the net direction of nutrient flows ties. It allows a sink to turn into a source and vice versa. This effect of nutrient flows on sobetween two ecosystems of contrasted productiviurce and sink dynamics is robust to the ecosystem structure (with and without herbivores) and to specific ecosystem compartments contributing to nutrient flows (primary producers, herbivores, or detritus). Ecosystems in distinct localities thus interact together with the structure at one place influencing that of the other. In meta ecosystems, the source-sink dynamics of an organism is not only constrained by its dispersal from the so.urce to the sink, but also by the fertility and community composition in the neighborhood responsible for spatial flows of nutrients and energy. The meta-ecosystem perspective provides a powerful theoretical framework to address novel questions in spatial ecosystem ecology},

abstract = {Seed dispersal is hard to measure, and there is still a lack of knowledge about dispersal-related traits of plant species. Therefore, we developed D3, the Dispersal and Diaspore Database (available at www.seed-dispersal.info), which aims at simplifying ecological and evolutionary analyses by providing and integrating various items related to seed dispersal: empirical studies, functional traits, image analyses and ranking indices (quantifying the adaptation to dispersal modes).Currently, the database includes data for more than 5000 taxa and 33 items as well as digital images of diaspores (i.e. the dispersal units), seeds, fruits and infructescences. The included items cover common traits like diaspore mass, size, shape, terminal velocity and seed number per diaspore. Furthermore, we present newly or further developed items like ecomorphological categorizations of the diaspore and fruit as well as information from literature on prevailing dispersal modes. Finally, we introduce several items which are not covered in other databases yet: surface structure and form of the diaspore, the exposure of the diaspores in the infructescence and dispersal rankings. Dispersal rankings allow estimations of how well certain species are adapted to a specific dispersal mode in comparison to a larger species set. They are calculated as the percentile rank of an indicator of species' dispersal potential in relation to a larger species set.Especially for the new and further developed items we outline the basic concepts in detail, describe the measurement and categorization methods and show how to interpret and integrate these data for single species as well as for larger species sets. Thereby, we calculate baseline statistics of seed dispersal of the Central European flora. We found that diaspores of 72{\%} of the taxa show specializations related to long-distance dispersal, i.e. most often elongated appendages or nutrient-rich tissues. Diaspore masses, sizes and terminal velocities vary over several orders of magnitude and can be approximated by lognormal distributions. ?? 2013 Perspectives in Plant Ecology, Evolution and Systematics.},

@article{Scherrer2020,
abstract = {Abstract Species range limits are expected to be dramatically altered under future climate change and many species are predicted to shift their distribution upslope to track their suitable conditions (i.e. based on their niche). However, there might be large discrepancies between the speed of the upward shift of the climatic niche and the actual migration velocity of the species, especially in long-lived organisms such as trees. In fact, most studies did not find any significant upward shift of the distributional limits of temperate forest trees over the last decades. It therefore beckons the questions why trees are moving upslope much slower than their bioclimatic envelope and what are the implications for ecosystem functioning. Here, we compared the simulations of the upslope displacement of the bioclimatic envelope of 16 tree species inhabiting temperate mountain forests under ongoing and future climate change obtained by correlative species distribution models (SDMs) to those from a dynamic forest model accounting for dispersal, competition and demography. We then partitioned the discrepancy in upslope migration velocity between the SDMs and the dynamic forest model into different components by manipulating dispersal limitation, interspecific competition and demography. Tree species in the dynamic forest model migrated only slowly upslope in contrast to the SDMs. Most of the difference in migration velocity can directly be attributed to tree?s demography (long life cycle), followed by effects of competition and only a marginal contribution of dispersal limitation. Additionally, lower elevation species (?non-treeline?) shifted slower upslope than high elevation species (?treeline?) indicating a strong effect of inter-specific competition at their leading edge. Synthesis. Forests have a high inertia to climate change because of their longevity and ability to acclimatise to high climatic fluctuations. Lower elevation tree species (deciduous) only slowly establish in stands at higher elevation where coniferous species dominate and likely profit from facilitation by disturbance events. Therefore, forest ecosystems seem to persist, even if climate becomes unfavourable, until they approach a tipping point at which an extreme event (e.g., drought, storm or insect attack) leads to a large dieback and resource change enabling new suitable species to spread and establish.},

abstract = {Fire hazard reduction treatments are commonly applied to mixed-species coniferous forests in western Montana, USA, to modify fuels structures and alter the competitive environments of individual trees. An improved understanding of how competition can be measured and how it conditions individual tree growth is needed for projecting the development of these forests, with and without treatment. Numerous studies have evaluated how competition affects tree growth and many indices have been developed to quantify the competition an individual tree experiences. These studies suggest that no single competition index or a single class of indices is universally superior; indices perform differently according to forest type and forest conditions. We chose several widely used distance-independent and distance-dependent competition indices, and also derived anisotropic distance-dependent indices from estimates of light interception by tree crowns. We evaluated the effectiveness of these competition measures for predicting basal area increment (BAI) of Pinus ponderosa, Pseudotsuga menziesii, and Larix occidentalis in western Montana. The best distance-dependent competition indices explained a larger proportion of growth var- iation than the best distance-independent indices (64{\%} vs. 56{\%}). This result indicates that competition is an important growth determinant in these forests and that competition varies locally, with variable tree densities and relatively complex stand structures creating heterogeneous neighborhood conditions. Com- petition indices derived from light interception models were only weakly correlated with other indices and performed poorly in terms of predicting tree growth. This result accords with previous observations that competition for light is not the primarily growth limitation for trees in the semi-arid conditions of western Montana. More sophisticated light availability models could be used to better assess variability in light interception and its marginal contribution to predictive accuracy of radial tree growth. Diameter and distance-dependent BAI models were developed for growth prediction at the species level and for all species combined.},

To further investigate the effect of speciation on neutral biodiversity, we analyze a spatially explicit neutral model based on population genetics.

abstract = {We explore the effects of temporal variation in multiple demographic rates on the joint evolution of delayed reproduction and seed dormancy using integral projection models (IPMs). To do this, we extend the standard IPM to include a discrete state variable representing the number of seeds in the seed bank, density-dependent recruitment, and temporal variation in demography. Parameter estimates for Carlina vulgaris and Carduus nutans are obtained from long-term studies. Carlina is relatively long lived and has a short-lived seed bank, whereas most Carduus plants flower in their first year and the seed bank is long lived. Using the evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) approach, we predict the observed flowering and germination strategies. There is excellent agreement between the predictions and the field observations. The effects of temporal variation on the joint ESS are partitioned into components arising from nonlinear averaging (systematic changes in the mean resulting from the interaction between variability and nonlinearity) and nonequilibrium dynamics (fluctuations in fitness caused by temporal variation). This shows that temporal variation can have substantial effects on the observed flowering and germination strategies and that covariance between demographic processes is important. We extend the models to include spatial population structure and assess the robustness of the results from the nonspatial models.},

@article{Hartig2014,
abstract = {If two species exhibit different nonlinear responses to a single shared resource, and if each species modifies the resource dynamics such that this favors its competitor, they may stably coexist. This coexistence mechanism, known as relative nonlinearity of competition, is well understood theoretically, but less is known about its evolutionary properties and its prevalence in real communities. We address this challenge by using adaptive dynamics theory and individual-based simulations to compare community stabilization and evolutionary stability of species that coexist by relative nonlinearity. In our analysis, evolution operates on the species' density-compensation strategies, and we consider a trade-off between population growth rates at high and low resource availability. We confirm previous findings that, irrespective of the particular model of density dependence, there are many combinations of overcompensating and undercompensating density-compensation strategies that allow stable coexistence by relative nonlinearity. However, our analysis also shows that most of these strategy combinations are not evolutionarily stable and will be outcompeted by an intermediate density-compensation strategy. Only very specific trade-offs lead to evolutionarily stable coexistence by relative nonlinearity. As we find no reason why these particular trade-offs should be common in nature, we conclude that the sympatric evolution and evolutionary stability of relative nonlinearity, while possible in principle, seems rather unlikely. We speculate that this may, at least in part, explain why empirical demonstrations of this coexistence mechanism are rare, noting, however, that the difficulty to detect relative nonlinearity in the field is an equally likely explanation for the current lack of empirical observations, and that our results are limited to communities with non-overlapping generations and constant resource supply. Our study highlights the need for combining ecological and evolutionary perspectives for gaining a better understanding of community assembly and biogeographic patterns.},

abstract = {Seventeen tree-ring chronologies from the conifer Araucaria araucana (Molina) K. Koch have been analyzed across its range of distribution in Argentina. We studied the growth patterns and determined the main cli- matic factors influencing A. araucana radial growth. All the chronologies show a strong common signal observed by the high amount of variance explained by the first principal component (PC1) and the high mean correlation (r = 0.597) between the chronologies over the 1676–1974 interval. On this basis, we developed a regional chronology that is 866 years long (A.D. 1140–2006) and includes 621 tree-ring series. Based on the PC2 scores, chronologies were clearly separated by elevation in high- and low-elevation records. Regional tree growth is strongly negatively related to tem- peratures during summer and fall in the previous-growing season and spring in the current-growing season, respec- tively. A positive association of tree growth with precipita- tion is recorded during spring in the current growing season. These results suggest a close relationship between A. araucana tree growth and water availability on a regional scale. This observation is also consistent with a positive and significant correlation between our A. araucana regional record and a reconstruction of November–December rainfall for northern Patagonia inferred from the xeric Austrocedrus chilensis during the past 400 years. Negative correlations between A. araucana regional growth and the sea surface temperature in the Nin ˜o 3.4 region reflect the occurrence of above-mean summer temperatures in the region during positive tropical Pacific SST anomalies. The negative rela- tionship with the Antarctic Oscillation (AAO) results from reduced precipitation in our study region during the positive phase of the AAO. The effect of elevation on water avail- ability is consistent with significant correlations between ring-width variations at lower elevations and the Palmer Drought Severity Index during spring and summer in the current growing season. Our study emphasizes the high dendroclimatological potential of A. araucana chronologies for reconstructing past climate variations in northern Pata- gonia during the past millennium.},

Theoretical studies showing the importance of CNDD often assumed that all species are equally susceptible to CNDD; however, recent empirical studies have shown species can differ greatly in their susceptibility to CNDD. Using a theoretical model, we show that interspecific variation in CNDD can dramatically alter its impact on diversity. First, if the most common species are the least regulated by CNDD, then the stabilising benefit of CNDD is reduced. Second, when seed dispersal is limited, seedlings that are susceptible to CNDD are at a competitive disadvantage. When parameterised with estimates of CNDD from a tropical tree community in Panama, our model suggests that the competitive inequalities caused by interspecific variation in CNDD may undermine many species' ability to persist. Thus, our model suggests that variable CNDD may make communities less stable, rather than more stable.},

Previous models highlighted how gene flow across spatial environmental gradients determines species expansion versus extinction and the location of species range limits. However, space is only one of two axes of environmental variation - environments also vary in time, and we know temporal environmental variation has important consequences for population demography and evolution. We used analytical and individual-based evolutionary models to explore how temporal variation in environmental conditions influences the spread of populations across a spatial environmental gradient. We find that temporal variation greatly alters our predictions for range dynamics compared to temporally static environments. When temporal variance is equal across the landscape, the fate of species (expansion versus extinction) is determined by the interaction between the degree of temporal autocorrelation in environmental fluctuations and the steepness of the spatial environmental gradient. When the magnitude of temporal variance changes across the landscape, stable range limits form where this variance increases maladaptation sufficiently to prevent local persistence. These results illustrate the pivotal influence of temporal variation on the likelihood of populations colonizing novel habitats and the location of species range limits.},

Results demonstrate that niche and neutrality form ends of a continuum from competitive to stochastic exclusion. In the absence of immigration, competitive exclusion tends to create a regular spacing of niches. However, immigration prevents the establishment of a limiting similarity.

abstract = {It is an ecological truism that population persistence depends on a population's growth rate when rare. To understand the interplay between temporal correlations, spatial heterogeneity and dispersal on persistence, an analytic approximation for this growth rate is derived for partially mixing populations. Partial mixing has two effects on population growth. In the absence of temporal correlations in relative fitness, greater movement to patches with, on average, higher relative fitness increases population growth rates. In the absence of spatial heterogeneity in the average relative fitnesses, lower dispersal rates enhance population growth when temporal autocorrelations of relative fitness within a patch exceed temporal cross-correlations in relative fitness between patches. This approximation implies that metapopulations whose expected fitness in every patch is less than 1 can persist if there are positive temporal autocorrelations in relative fitness, sufficiently weak spatial correlations and the population disperses at intermediate rates. It also implies that movement into lower quality habitats increases the population growth rate whenever the net temporal variation in per capita growth rates is sufficiently larger than the difference in the means of these per capita growth rates. Moreover, temporal autocorrelations, whether they be negative or positive, can enhance population growth for optimal dispersal strategies {\textcopyright} 2010 The Royal Society.},

abstract = {Matrix projection models occupy a central role in population and conservation biology. Matrix models divide a population into discrete classes, even if the structuring trait exhibits continuous variation (e.g., body size). The integral projection model (IPM) avoids discrete classes and potential artifacts from arbitrary class divisions, facilitates parsimonious modeling based on smooth relationships between individual state and demographic performance, and can be implemented with standard matrix software. Here, we extend the IPM to species with complex demographic attributes, including dormant and active life stages, cross-classification by several attributes (e.g., size, age, and condition), and changes between discrete and continuous structure over the life cycle. We present a general model encompassing these cases, numerical methods, and theoretical results, including stable population growth and sensitivity/ elasticity analysis for density-independent models, local stability analysis in density-dependent models, and optimal/evolutionarily stable strategy life-history analysis. Our presentation centers on an IPM for the thistle Onopordum illyricum based on a 6-year field study. Flowering and death probabilities are size and age dependent, and individuals also vary in a latent attribute affecting survival, but a predictively accurate IPM is completely parameterized by fitting a few regression equations.

abstract = {Despite the decades-long recognition of the importance of scaling in ecology, our knowledge about many ecological patterns and processes is still largely restricted to particular spatial and temporal scale domains with relatively narrow ranges. There is no exception when it comes to the study of biodiversity, one of the most important and active research fields in ecology. Increasing work suggests that such narrow ranges of scales are in most cases inadequate for addressing conservation challenges associated with biodiversity change. The need for understanding how biodiversity is shaped and will change across different scales is stronger than ever. Here, we review recent progresses of up-scaling and down-scaling biodiversity in the context of global environmental change, with focus on two relatively large spatial scale domains, i.e., the landscape and macroecological scales. Landscape ecology and macroecology are both active, but so-far poorly connected research fields. They share a common central motivation of unraveling spatial patterning of biodiversity and the underlying mechanisms. Our literature review suggests that landscape-scale processes may exert unexpected up-scaling effects to shape biodiversity patterns at macroecological scales, while macroecological processes may generate a range of down-scaling effects on landscape biodiversity. Specifically, although there is a lack of consensus on the underlying mechanisms, it is likely that landscape processes scale up through connectivity and feedback loops within and across landscapes to affect macroecological biodiversity responses. On the other hand, the down-scaling effects of macroecological processes on biodiversity is often confounded with small-scale processes, leading to various responses inconsistent with direct down-scaling extrapolations. In addition, the temporal dimension is indispensable to investigating effects and mechanisms of cross-scale processes. Specifically, long-term (decades and beyond) perspectives are necessary for re-evaluating ecological knowledge obtained from biodiversity responses to short-term environmental changes and recognizing historical legacies of both landscape and macroecological processes on biodiversity at the two spatial scales. Overall, scaling analyses of ecological processes across spatial extents ranging from small habitats to the globe have revealed biodiversity responses to anthropogenic environmental changes as inconsistent with assumptions and extrapolations based on extant ecological knowledge at a few fixed scales. Such analyses are needed to better inform conservation actions and planning practiced mainly at local to macroecological scales. We suggest that elucidating cross-scaling mechanisms and accumulating long-term time series at multiple spatial scales are key to linking landscape ecology and macroecology in terms of biodiversity dynamics. Such efforts would be an important contribution to the ecological basis for managing biodiversity change in the Anthropocene, as these dynamics involve multiple up-scaling and down-scaling processes over time.},

abstract = {Studies of ecosystem responses to climate change often focus on potential equilibria in species or community distributions, overlooking the transitions to new equilibrium states. Transient phases can however last for decades or centuries, during which both demography and interspecific interactions are expected to play a crucial role. Here, we investigate the response of vegetation to climate warming at high latitudes involving a shift from open vegetation to either boreal (mainly coniferous) or temperate (mainly deciduous) forests. We specifically address how interactions among browsers and vegetation could affect the shift in dominance of vegetation type after climate warming. We characterize the transient dynamics using five measures: 1) asymptotic resilience, i.e. the rate at which equilibrium is restored, 2) initial resilience, the short-term rate of change of the ecosystem after climate change, 3) ecosystem exposure, i.e. the shift of the equilibrium due to climate change, 4) sensitivity, or the time to recover equilibrium, and 5) vulnerability, measured as the cumulative amount of changes in vegetation states during the transient phase. We find that plant–herbivore interactions usually extend the length of the transient period and induce more cumulative changes in vegetation types. This result implies that the consideration of multiple interacting species is necessary to provide robust scenarios of how ecosystems will respond to global changes. We furthermore show that plant–herbivore interactions disrupt the correlation between the five measures characterizing the transient dynamics, highlighting the need for a full multidimensional characterization of transients.},

Yet, the characteristics of interactions that predispose them to disruption are largely unknown. We analyzed 12 pollination webs from isolated hills ("sierras"), in Argentina, ranging from tens to thousands of hectares. We found evidence of nonrandom loss of interactions with decreasing sierra size. Low interaction frequency and high specialization between interacting partners contributed additively to increase the vulnerability of interactions to disruption. Interactions between generalists in the largest sierras were ubiquitous across sierras, but many of them lost their central structural role in the smallest sierras. Thus, particular configurations of interaction networks, along with unique ecological relations and evolutionary pathways, could be lost forever after habitat reduction.},

abstract = {1. The effects of the present biodiversity crisis have been largely focused on the loss of species. However, a missed component of biodiversity loss that often accompanies or even precedes species disappearance is the extinction of ecological interactions. 2. Here, we propose a novel model that (i) relates the diversity of both species and interactions along a gradient of environmental deterioration and (ii) explores how the rate of loss of ecological functions, and consequently of ecosystem services, can be accelerated or restrained depending on how the rate of species loss covaries with the rate of interactions loss. 3. We find that the loss of species and interactions are decoupled, such that ecological interactions are often lost at a higher rate. This implies that the loss of ecological interactions may occur well before species disappearance, affecting species functionality and ecosystems services at a faster rate than species extinctions. We provide a number of empirical case studies illustrating these points. 4. Our approach emphasizes the importance of focusing on species interactions as the major biodiversity component from which the ‘health' of ecosystems depends. Key-words:},

abstract = {We present a model of plant-nutrient interactions that extends classical resource competition theory to environments in which essential nutrients (resources) are recycled between plant and soil pools and dissolved nutrients are lost through plant-available (i.e., inorganic forms) or plant-unavailable (i.e., complex organic forms) pathways. Losses by dissolved organic pathways can alter ratios of nutrients that are recycled and supplied within the plant-soil system, thereby influencing competition and coexistence among plant species. In special cases, our extended model does not differ from classical models, but in more realistic cases our model introduces new dynamical behavior that influences competitive outcomes. At equilibrium, coexistence still depends on nutrient supply and consumption, but nutrient supply includes recycling and is highly sensitive to whether a species promotes more organic losses of the nutrient that limits its own growth than of nutrients that limit its competitors. Because recycling operates with a time delay compared with consumption, recycling-mediated effects on competition can, under certain conditions, lead to sustained population oscillations. Our findings have implications for how we understand nutrient competition, nutrient cycles, and plant evolutionary strategies. {\textcopyright} 2005 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

abstract = {Increasingly, the success of management interventions aimed at biodiversity conservation are viewed as being dependent on the 'resilience' of the system. Although the term 'resilience' is increasingly used by policy makers and environmental managers, the concept of 'resilience' remains vague, varied and difficult to quantify. Here we clarify what this concept means from an ecological perspective, and how it can be measured and applied to ecosystem management. We argue that thresholds of disturbance are central to measuring resilience. Thresholds are important because they offer a means to quantify how much disturbance an ecosystem can absorb before switching to another state, and so indicate whether intervention might be necessary to promote the recovery of the pre-disturbance state. We distinguish between helpful resilience, where resilience helps recovery, and unhelpful resilience where it does not, signalling the presence of a threshold and the need for intervention. Data to determine thresholds are not always available and so we consider the potential for indices of functional diversity to act as proxy measures of resilience. We also consider the contributions of connectivity and scale to resilience and how to incorporate these factors into management. We argue that linking thresholds to functional diversity indices may improve our ability to predict the resilience of ecosystems to future, potentially novel, disturbances according to their spatial and temporal scales of influence. Throughout, we provide guidance for the application of the resilience concept to ecosystem management. In doing so, we confirm its usefulness for improving biodiversity conservation in our rapidly changing world.},

Initial predictions have been that such changes will be accompanied by an erosion of genetic variation and increased interpopulation genetic divergence due to increased random genetic drift, elevated inbreeding and reduced gene flow. Results of recent empirical studies suggest that while genetic variation may decrease with reduced remnant population size, not all fragmentation events lead to genetic losses and different types of genetic variation (e.g. allozyme and quantitative variation) may respond differently. In some circumstances, fragmentation actually appears to increase gene flow among remnant populations, breaking down local genetic structure.},

abstract = {The perceived threat of climate change is often evaluated from species distribution models that are fitted to many species independently and then added together. This approach ignores the fact that species are jointly distributed and limit one another. Species respond to the same underlying climatic variables, and the abundance of any one species can be constrained by competition; a large increase in one is inevitably linked to declines of others. Omitting this basic relationship explains why responses modeled independently do not agree with the species richness or basal areas of actual forests. We introduce a joint species distribution modeling approach (JSDM), which is unique in three ways, and apply it to forests of eastern North America. First, it accommodates the joint distribution of species. Second, this joint distribution includes both abundance and presence– absence data. We solve the common issue of large numbers of zeros in abundance data by accommodating zeros in both stem counts and basal area data, i.e., a new approach to zero inflation. Finally, inverse prediction can be applied to the joint distribution of predictions to integrate the role of climate risks across all species and identify geographic areas where communities will change most (in terms of changes in abundance) with climate change. Application to forests in the eastern United States shows that climate can have greatest impact in the Northeast, due to temperature, and in the Upper Midwest, due to temperature and precipitation. Thus, these are the regions experiencing the fastest warming and are also identified as most responsive at this scale.},

Kalmia reductions were greatest in plots that received the highest total N loading (1344 kg N . Ha(-1)), but were also apparent in plots that received 672 kg N . Ha(-1). The reductions could not be attributed to shading, since tree volume response was small in the plots that received the highest N loading. There was an overall reduction in the amount of ground vegetation in the fertilized plots, so the decline could not be attributed to increased competition from invading species. There was a general negative relationship between the abundance of Kalmia and N availability in the forest floor, in fertilized and straw-amended plots. The reductions in Kalmia cover were still apparent 14 years after the last fertilization and 24 years after the straw application, as was higher N availability. Treatments such as repeated N fertilization or organic amendments that increase N availability in the forest floor may be an option for control of Kalmia in conifer plantations.},

Inbreeding, SGS and realized patterns of pollen and seed dispersal of the dioecious, wind pollinated Araucaria angustifolia were investigated based on microsatellite loci. The study was conducted in a 7.2 ha plot established within a continuous Araucaria Forest in Southern Brazil. In the plot, all 290 adult trees were mapped, measured (diameter at breast height, dbh), sexed, sampled and genotyped. We also sampled, measured (total height), mapped and genotyped 223 juveniles. A total of 86 alleles were detected in the sample (n = 513). Adults and juveniles showed a positive and significant fixation index (minimum of 0.096), suggesting inbreeding or Wahlund effect. Juveniles presented a significant aggregated distribution which was associated with a genetic aggregation (significant SGS up to 20 m), indicating that near neighbor trees may be related due the limited seed dispersal. However, the intensity of SGS was not significantly higher among juveniles (Sp = 0.0041) than adults (Sp = 0.0026). Realized pollen and seed immigration into the plot was low (pollen = 6 {\%}; seeds = 5 {\%}) and the patterns of pollen and seed dispersal were similar. Pollen was dispersed over long distances (343 m), but 50 {\%} was dispersed up to 124 m. Seeds also reached long distances (318 m), with 50 {\%} being dispersed up to 133 m.

abstract = {Ecological approaches to community assembly have emphasized the interplay between neutral processes, niche-based environmental filtering and niche-based species sorting in an interactive milieu. Recently, progress has been made in terms of aligning our vocabulary with conceptual advances, assessing how trait-based community functional parameters differ from neutral expectation and assessing how traits vary along environmental gradients. Experiments have confirmed the influence of these processes on assembly and have addressed the role of dispersal in shaping local assemblages. Community phylogenetics has forged common ground between ecologists and biogeographers, but it is not a proxy for trait-based approaches. Community assembly theory is in need of a comparative synthesis that addresses how the relative importance of niche and neutral processes varies among taxa, along environmental gradients, and across scales. Towards that goal, we suggest a set of traits that probably confer increasing community neutrality and regionality and review the influences of stress, disturbance and scale on the importance of niche assembly. We advocate increasing the complexity of experiments in order to assess the relative importance of multiple processes. As an example, we provide evidence that dispersal, niche processes and trait interdependencies have about equal influence on trait-based assembly in an experimental grassland.},

We present three approaches for identifying what factors distinguish those "lucky" individuals who come to dominate reproduction in a population without fixed differences between individuals (genotype, site quality, etc.): comparing life-history trajectories for lucky and unlucky individuals and calculating the elasticity of the probability of becoming lucky to perturbations in demographic rates at a given size or a given age. As examples we consider published size-structured integral projection models for the tropical tree Dacrydium elatum and the semiarid shrub Artemisia ordosica and an age-size-structured matrix model for the tropical tree Cedrela ordosica. We find that good fortune (e.g., rapid growth) when small and young matters much more than good fortune when older and larger. Becoming lucky is primarily a matter of surviving while others die. For species with more variable growth (such as Cedrela and Ordosica), it is also a matter of growing fast. We focus on reproductive skew, but our methods are broadly applicable and can be used to investigate how individuals come to be exceptional in any aspect.},

abstract = {Temperate tree species are expected to expand their distribution into the boreal forest in response to climate change. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that many species will experience significant setbacks in capacity to migrate due to a series of unfavourable conditions impacting their recruitment success, and thus their ability to colonize new locations. We quantify the relative influence of a series of factors important for tree seedling recruitment at range margins: propagule dispersal, substrate favourability and the influence of the local hetero-specific species canopy composition. We hypothesized that boreal trees are responsible for priority effects that influence the establishment of temperate tree species seedlings. To do so, we analysed two recruitment stages (first-year seedlings and older seedlings) for seven tree species: Abies balsamea (ABBA), Acer rubrum (ACRU), Acer saccharum (ACSA), Betula papyrifera (BEPA), Betula alleghaniensis (BEAL), Populus tremuloides (POTR) and Fagus grandifolia (FAGR) commonly found within the temperate-boreal ecotone forests of northeastern North America. Overall, we found that boreal canopy trees influence the distribution of substrates, more specifically the occurrence of needle cover and decayed wood in recruitment plots. Interestingly, decayed wood was a poor substrate in almost all cases. This association between canopy and substrate led to highly unfavourable substrates that affected the seedling densities of all temperate tree species. In addition, we found that seedling dispersion was highly localized, where the mean dispersal distance of all trees occurred in close proximity of parent trees. Synthesis. Unfavourable substrates and limited mean dispersal distance of trees due to resident boreal trees generate (strong) priority effects within the temperate-boreal ecotone. Together, these conditions promise to cause significant lags in temperate tree species migration into the boreal forest in the future.},

abstract = {Characteristics of tree species may uniquely situate them to withstand environmental changes. Paleoecological evidence indicates that the geographic ranges of tree species have expanded and contracted several times since the last glacial epoch in response to directional environmental changes. For most tree species, these range fluctuations have been accomplished without any apparent loss of genetic diversity. A possible explanation that distinguishes most trees from many herbaceous plants is that much of the genetic variation within tree species is found within rather than among their populations. Thus, the extinction of a relatively large proportion of a tree species' populations would result in relatively little overall loss of genetic diversity. Furthermore, phylogeographic studies indicate that for some tree species, habitat heterogeneity (elevation, slope aspect, moisture, etc.) in glacial refugia may have preserved adaptive genetic variation that, when recombined and exposed to selection in newly colonized habitats, gave rise to the local adaptation currently seen. The maintenance of genetic diversity in the face of extensive habitat fragmentation is also a concern. Many forest trees, however, may be buffered from the adverse effects of habitat fragmentation. First, the longevity of individual trees may retard population extinction and allow individuals and populations to survive until habitat recovery occurs. Second, considerable evidence is available that both animal and wind-pollinated tree species in fragments experience levels of pollen flow that are sufficient to counteract the effects of genetic drift. The combination of individual longevity, high intra-population genetic diversity and the potential for high rates of pollen flow should make tree species especially resistant to extinction and the loss of genetic diversity during changing environmental conditions. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The paradox of enrichment has been studied almost exclusively within communities or metacommunities, without explicit nutrient dynamics. Yet local recycling of materials from enriched ecosystems may affect the stability of connected ecosystems. Here we study the effect of nutrient, detritus, producer, and consumer spatial flows-combined with changes in regional enrichment-on the stability of a metaecosystem model. We considered both spatially homogeneous and heterogeneous enrichment. We found that nutrient and detritus spatial flows are destabilizing, whereas producer or consumer spatial flows are either neutral or stabilizing. We noticed that detritus spatial flows have only a weak impact on stability. Our study reveals that heterogeneity no longer stabilizes well-connected systems when accounting for explicit representation of nutrient dynamics. We also found that intermediate consumer diffusion could lead to multiple equilibria in strongly enriched metaecosystems. Stability can emerge from a top-down control allowing the storage of materials into inorganic form, a mechanism never documented before. In conclusion, local enrichment can be stabilized if spatial flows are strong enough to efficiently redistribute the local excess of enrichment to unfertile ecosystems. However, high regional enrichment can be dampened only by intermediate consumer diffusion rates.},

abstract = {Aim Decision-making for conservation management often involves evaluating risks in the face of environmental uncertainty. Models support decision-making by (1) synthesizing available knowledge in a systematic, rational and transparent way and (2) providing a platform for exploring and resolving uncertainty about the consequences of management decisions. Despite their benefits, models are still not used in many conservation decision-making contexts. In this article, we provide evidence of common objections to the use of models in environmental decision-making. In response, we present a series of practical solutions for modellers to help improve the effectiveness and relevance of their work in conservation decision-making. Location Global review. Methods We reviewed scientific and grey literature for evidence of common objections to the use of models in conservation decision-making. We present a set of practical solutions based on theory, empirical evidence and best-practice examples to help modellers substantively address these objections. Results We recommend using a structured decision-making framework to guide good modelling practice in decision-making and highlight a variety of modelling techniques that can be used to support the process. We emphasize the importance of participatory decision-making to improve the knowledge-base and social acceptance of decisions and to facilitate better conservation outcomes. Improving communication and building trust are key to successfully engaging participants, and we suggest some practical solutions to help modellers develop these skills. Main conclusions If implemented, we believe these practical solutions could help broaden the use of models, forging deeper and more appropriate linkages between science and management for the improvement of conservation decision-making.

abstract = {1. Animportant problem encountered by ecologists in species distribution modelling (SDM)and inmultivariate analysis is that of understanding why environmental responses differ across species, and how differences are mediated by functional traits. 2. We describe a simple, generic approach to this problem – the core idea being to fit a predictive model for species abundance (or presence/absence) as a function of environmental variables, species traits and their interaction. 3. We show that this method can be understood as a model-based approach to the fourth-corner problem – the problem of studying the environment–trait association using matrices of abundance or presence/absence data across species, environmental data across sites and trait data across species. The matrix of environment–trait interaction coefficients is the fourth corner. 4. We illustrate that compared with existing approaches to the fourth-corner problem, the proposedmodel-based approach has advantages in interpretability and its capacity to perform model selection andmake predictions. 5. To illustrate the method we used a generalized linear model with a LASSO penalty, fitted to data sets from four different studies requiring different models, illustrating the flexibility of the proposed approach. 6. Predictive performance of the model is compared with that of fitting SDMs separately to each species, and in each case, it is shown that the trait model, despite beingmuch simpler, had comparable predictive performance, even significantly outperforming separate SDMs in some cases.

abstract = {The distributions of many terrestrial organisms are currently shifting in latitude or elevation in response to changing climate. Using a meta-analysis, we estimated that the distributions of species have recently shifted to higher elevations at a median rate of 11.0 meters per decade, and to higher latitudes at a median rate of 16.9 kilometers per decade. These rates are approximately two and three times faster than previously reported. The distances moved by species are greatest in studies showing the highest levels of warming, with average latitudinal shifts being generally sufficient to track temperature changes. However, individual species vary greatly in their rates of change, suggesting that the range shift of each species depends on multiple internal species traits and external drivers of change. Rapid average shifts derive from a wide diversity of responses by individual species.},

Palaeoecological evidence indicates that forest expansion over grassland initiated after the mid Holocene, when climate changed towards present day cool and moist conditions. In this paper, we discuss landscape level changes that occurred on vegetation patterns after grazing and fire exclusion in a mosaic of Campos and Araucaria forest in Southern Brazil. The analysis of aerial photographs from 1974 and 1999 showed alterations on grassland communities under grazing and fire exclusion, especially pronounced shrub establishment near the edge of the forest. Considering the change in the cover of vegetation classes relative to the total altered cover in all classes from 1974 to 1999, the most prominent alterations were: 48{\%} from grassland with tussock grasses dominance (GRA) to grassland with shrubs (GSR), 24{\%} from GRA to grassland with tall shrubs (GTS), 16{\%} from GSR to GTS and 9{\%} from GTS to forest (FOR). Considering the alteration relatively to the vegetation cover in 1974, the most relevant changes were: 44{\%} from GSR to GTS and 94{\%} from GTS to FOR.

abstract = {Trait analysis aims to understand relationships between traits, species diversity, and the environment. Current methods could benefit from a model-based probabilistic framework that accommodates covariance between traits and quantifies contributions from inherent trait syndromes, species interactions, and responses to the environment. I develop a model-based approach that separates these effects on trait diversity. Application to USDA Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data in the eastern United States demonstrates an apparent paradox, that the analysis of species better explains and predicts traits than does direct analysis of the traits themselves; trait data contain less, not more, information than species on environmental responses. Whereas variation in some traits is dominated by inherent syndromes (tendency for certain traits to be associated with others within an individual and species), others are strongly controlled by variation in species diversity.

abstract = {To investigate how accurately biparentage assignments for coniferous seeds can be improved by using different kinds of seed tissues, we assigned biparentage to dispersed seeds in a natural stand of Pinus densiflora Siebold {\&} Zucc. (288 mature trees) using two procedures: with or without megagametophyte haplotype data ("MH" and "ordinary" procedures, respectively). Using archived clones, we confirmed the conifer-specific modes of inheritance of three kinds of seed tissues from certain maternal trees using six microsatellite markers. In the natural stand, under the MH procedure, 39.2{\%} of male parents and 77.0{\%} of female parents for a total of 204 seeds analyzed were assigned to at least one mature tree within the study area. At that time, the proportion of exactly matching seeds out of seeds with one matching parent under the MH procedure was significantly larger than that of the seeds under the ordinary procedure. The biparentage assignments under the ordinary procedure corresponded to only 53.7{\%} of the accurate separate assignments under the MH procedure. It is suggested that analyzing different seed tissues is effective for exact and accurate biparentage assignments in investigations of biparentally mediated gene flow in coniferous populations, particularly at the seed-dispersal stage.},

We used the isozyme method to analyze 11 ecotypes representing the latitudinal and longitudinal profiles within the species range, including samples from the geographic boundaries of the distribution. The genetic structure of the ecotypes is described on the basis of the variability for 26 isozyme loci encoding for 16 enzyme systems. The greatest genetic diversity was observed in the taiga ecotypes in the central part of the studied area, while the ecotypes along the species range boundaries were shown to be genetically depauperized. Approximately 8.1 {\%} of the observed genetic diversity is attributed to differences between the studied ecotypes. We detected high levels of genetic diversity for the Fest-2, Pgm-1, Sod-4, and a few other loci, as well as a correlation between allele frequencies and geographical locations of the populations. The results of multivariate analysis of allelic frequencies as well as cluster analysis allowed us to discriminate three major groups of ecotypes: north-eastern, central and south-western. In view of our results, we compare two hypotheses: one which attributes the spatial distribution of genetic variations to the selectivity for some of the polymorphic allozyme loci, and the other based in the history of the formation of the range of the Siberian stone pine. 2014 Pleiades Publishing, Inc.},

abstract = {Whether biotic interactions limit geographic ranges has long been controversial, and traditional analyses of static distribution patterns have made little progress towards resolving this debate. Here, we use a novel phylogenetic approach to test whether biotic interactions constrain the transition to secondary sympatry following speciation. Applying this temporal framework to a diverse clade of passerine birds (Furnariidae), we reject models of geographic range overlap limited purely by dispersal or environmental constraints, and instead show that rates of secondary sympatry are positively associated with both the phylogenetic and morphological distance between species. Thus, transition rates to sympatry increase with time since divergence and accelerate as the ecological differences between species accumulate. Taken together, these results provide strong empirical evidence that biotic interactions - and primarily ecological competition - limit species distributions across large spatial and temporal scales. They also offer phylogenetic and trait-based metrics by which these interactions can be incorporated into ecological forecasting models.},

abstract = {Premise of the study: Genetic variability in monoecious woody plant populations results from the assemblage of individuals issued from asymmetrical male and female reproductive functions, produced during spatially and temporarily heterogeneous reproductive and dispersal events. Here we investigated the dispersal patterns and levels of genetic diversity and differentiation of both paternal and maternal gametes in a natural population of Pinus densiflora at the multiple-year scale as long as five consecutive years. Methods: We analyzed the paternity and maternity for 1576 seeds and 454 candidate adult trees using nuclear DNA polymorphisms of diploid biparental embryos and haploid maternal megagametophytes at eight microsatellite loci. Key results: Despite the low levels of genetic differentiation among gamete groups, a two-way AMOVA analysis showed that the parental origin (paternal vs. maternal gametes), the year of gamete production and their interaction had significant effects on the genetic composition of the seeds. While maternal gamete groups showed a significant FST value across the 5 years, this was not true for their paternal counterparts. Within the population, we found that the relative reproductive contributions of the paternal vs. the maternal parent differed among adult trees, the maternal contributions showing a larger year-to-year fluctuation. Conclusions: The overall genetic variability of dispersed seeds appeared to result from two sources of heterogeneity: the difference between paternal and maternal patterns of reproduction and gamete dispersal and year-to-year heterogeneity of reproduction of adult trees, especially in their maternal reproduction. {\textcopyright} 2013 Botanical Society of America.},

abstract = {1. With global change modifying species assemblages, our success in predicting ecosystem-level consequences of these new communities will depend, in part, on our ability to understand biotic interactions. Current food web theory considers interactions between numerous species simultaneously, but descriptive models are unable to predict interactions between newly co-occurring species. Incorporating proxies such as functional traits and phylogeny into models could help infer predator/prey interactions. Here, we used trait matching between predator feeding traits and prey vulnerability traits, along with phylogeny (used as a proxy for chemical defence and other traits difficult to document), to infer predatory interactions using ground beetles as model organisms. A feeding experiment was conducted involving 20 ground beetle and 115 prey species to determine which pair of species did or did not interact. Eight predator and four prey functional traits were measured directly on specimens. Then, using a modelling approach based on the matching-centrality formalism, we evaluated 511 predictive ecological models that tested different combinations of all predator and prey functional traits, and phylogenetic information. The most parsimonious model accurately predicted 81{\%} of the observed realized and unrealized interactions, using phylogenetic information and the trait-matches predator biting force/prey cuticular toughness and predator/prey body size ratio. The best trait-based models predicted correctly {\textgreater}80{\%} which species interact (realized interactions), but predict {\textless}58{\%} of which species did not interact (unrealized interactions). Adding a phylogenetic term representing the evolutionary distance within each trophic level increased the ability to predict which species did not interact to {\textgreater}75{\%}. The matching of predator biting force and prey cuticular toughness demonstrated a better predictive power than the commonly used predator/prey body size ratio. Our novel model combining both functional traits and phylogeny extends beyond existing descriptive approaches and could represent a valuable tool to predict consumer/resource interactions of newly introduced species and to resolve cryptic food webs.},

In Rio Grande do Sul, it occurs mainly in the highlands of the planalto region, as a tree-component of the mixed ombrophyllous forests. The species is valuable for its wood, edible seeds, and ornamental use, and is today listed as a threatened species. This tree-species establishes associations with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, and assessing the impact of such association to the species-performance will help us in defining the management procedures for its use in conservation and sustainable purposes. In this study, we tested the nutritional and growth responses of seedlings to inoculation with Glomus clarum,a fungal species identified in the rhizosphere of Brazilian pine in natural stands. A greenhouse study was conducted, where plants were either inoculated with G. clarum or with a sterilized version of the same inoculum. Plant growth was evaluated over a 21-month period by measuring the total shoot length, and, at the end, by plant dry mass, leaf nutrient content, and root colonization. Seedlings inoculated with G. clarum had a high degree of mycorrhizal colonization of their roots (81{\%}). The inoculated seedlings grewsignificantly more (312{\%} mass increase) than the controls, which had a higher root:shoot ratio than the inoculated seedlings. Leaf concentrations of P, K, Na, and Cu were higher while those of Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn, and B were lower in the inoculated plants. The results indicate a strong response of A. angustifolia to mycorrhizas, suggesting a high degree of dependence of the species on these associations.},

abstract = {Although it is widely predicted that the geographic distributions of tree species and forest types will undergo substantial shifts in future, modelling approaches used to date are largely unable to project the pace at which forest distributions will respond to environmental change. The expansion and contraction of forest distributions act against considerable demographic inertia in the present composition and size-structure of forest stands as climate-induced changes in growth, mortality, and recruitment alter population dynamics through time. We aimed to better understand how shifts in forest distributions reflect long-term changes in tree demographic rates and population dynamics, and how such shifts are influenced by 1) disturbance from forest harvesting and 2) local environmental heterogeneity. Using a simple, data-constrained gap model, we simulated regional forest dynamics in the eastern United States over the next 500 yr. We then compared the geographic distributions of five different forest types through time under present and altered climatic conditions, in scenarios that variously included and excluded forest harvesting and environmental heterogeneity. Although we held climate fixed after 100 yr, it took another 160 yr after this for these forest types to collectively experience 90{\%} of their eventual climate-related distribution gains and losses. Competition strongly affected the nature of responses to climate change. Harvesting accelerated and amplified gains by an early-successional forest type at the expense of a late-successional one, but these gains did not occur faster than those for other forest types. Environmental heterogeneity had little effect on distribution gains or losses through time. These findings indicate that forest distributions should respond quite slowly to climate change, with the leading and trailing edges of different forest types shifting over a span of centuries. Disturbances can expedite some transitions, but are unlikely to lead to wholesale changes in forest types in the coming decades.},

This problem has been studied extensively in a different context by theoreticians evaluating the coexistence of species in spatially heterogeneous environments. Here, we show how spatial coexistence theory can be adapted to provide a mathematical framework for understanding species persistence in competitive communities under climate change. We first show how the spatial low-density growth rate provides the relevant metric of species persistence along a climate gradient. We then analyse a model of multiple migrating competitors to show how mechanisms contributing to low-density growth rates quantify the effect of different competitive processes on persistence, and how these processes change in strength with species' asynchronous migration under climate change. Finally, we outline the empirical utility of the framework, showing how the theory can scale up from local measurements of species performance and competitive interactions to range-scale metrics of persistence. Treating species' range dynamics as a geographical-scale coexistence problem presents its own set of challenges, but building from a well-established body of theory may greatly improve the predictability of species persistence in competitive communities under climate change.},

abstract = {State and transition models provide a simple and versatile way of describing vegetation dynamics in rangelands. However, state and transition models are traditionally descriptive, which has limited their practical application to rangeland management decision support. This paper demonstrates an approach to rangeland management decision support that combines a state and transition model with a Bayesian belief network to provide a relatively simple and updatable rangeland dynamics model that can accommodate uncertainty and be used for scenario, diagnostic, and sensitivity analysis. A state and transition model, developed by the authors for subtropical grassland in south-east Queensland, Australia, is used as an example. From the state and transition model, an influence diagram was built to show the possible transitions among states and the factors influencing each transition. The influence diagram was populated with probabilities to produce a predictive model in the form of a Bayesian belief network. The behaviour of the model was tested using scenario and sensitivity analysis, revealing that selective grazing, grazing pressure, and soil nutrition were believed to influence most transitions, while fire frequency and the frequency of good wet seasons were also important in some transitions. Overall, the integration of a state and transition model with a Bayesian belief network provided a useful way to utilise the knowledge embedded in a state and transition model for predictive purposes. Using a Bayesian belief network in the modelling approach allowed uncertainty and variability to be explicitly accommodated in the modelling process, and expert knowledge to be utilised in model development. The methods used also supported learning from monitoring data, thereby supporting adaptive rangeland management. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Increasing biodiversity loss due to climate change is one of the most vital challenges of the 21st century. To anticipate and mitigate biodiversity loss, models are needed that reliably project species' range dynamics and extinction risks. Recently, several new approaches to model range dynamics have been developed to supplement correlative species distribution models (SDMs), but applications clearly lag behind model development. Indeed, no comparative analysis has been performed to evaluate their performance. Here, we build on process-based, simulated data for benchmarking five range (dynamic) models of varying complexity including classical SDMs, SDMs coupled with simple dispersal or more complex population dynamic models (SDM hybrids), and a hierarchical Bayesian process-based dynamic range model (DRM). We specifically test the effects of demographic and community processes on model predictive performance. Under current climate, DRMs performed best, although only marginally. Under climate change, predictive performance varied considerably, with no clear winners. Yet, all range dynamic models improved predictions under climate change substantially compared to purely correlative SDMs, and the population dynamic models also predicted reasonable extinction risks for most scenarios. When benchmarking data were simulated with more complex demographic and community processes, simple SDM hybrids including only dispersal often proved most reliable. Finally, we found that structural decisions during model building can have great impact on model accuracy, but prior system knowledge on important processes can reduce these uncertainties considerably. Our results reassure the clear merit in using dynamic approaches for modelling species' response to climate change but also emphasise several needs for further model and data improvement. We propose and discuss perspectives for improving range projections through combination of multiple models and for making these approaches operational for large numbers of species.},

abstract = {Climate change is expected to lead to upslope shifts in tree species distributions, but the evidence is mixed partly due to land-use effects and individualistic species responses to climate. We examined how individual tree species demography varies along elevational climatic gradients across four states in the northeastern United States to determine whether species elevational distributions and their potential upslope (or downslope) shifts were controlled by climate, land-use legacies (past logging), or soils. We characterized tree demography, microclimate, land-use legacies, and soils at 83 sites stratified by elevation ({\~{}}500 to {\~{}}1200 m above sea level) across 12 mountains containing the transition from northern hardwood to spruce-fir forests. We modeled elevational distributions of tree species saplings and adults using logistic regression to test whether sapling distributions suggest ongoing species range expansion upslope (or contraction downslope) relative to adults, and we used linear mixed models to determine the extent to which climate, land use, and soil variables explain these distributions. Tree demography varied with elevation by species, suggesting a potential upslope shift only for American beech, downslope shifts for red spruce (more so in cool regions) and sugar maple, and no change with elevation for balsam fir. While soils had relatively minor effects, climate was the dominant predictor for most species and more so for saplings than adults of red spruce, sugar maple, yellow birch, cordate birch, and striped maple. On the other hand, logging legacies were positively associated with American beech, sugar maple, and yellow birch, and negatively with red spruce and balsam fir – generally more so for adults than saplings. All species exhibited individualistic rather than synchronous demographic responses to climate and land use, and the return of red spruce to lower elevations where past logging originally benefited northern hardwood species indicates that land use may mask species range shifts caused by changing climate.},

abstract = {Forest insect outbreaks can have large impacts on ecosystems and understanding the underlying ecological processes is critical for their management. Current process-based modeling approaches of insect outbreaks are often based on population processes operating at small spatial scales (i.e. within individual forest stands). As such, they are difficult to parameterize and offer limited applicability when modeling and predicting outbreaks at the landscape level where management actions take place. In this paper, we propose a new process-based landscape model of forest insect outbreaks that is based on stand defoliation, the Forest-Infected-Recovering-Forest (FIRF) model. We explore both spatially-implicit (mean field equations with global dispersal) and spatially-explicit (cellular automata with limited dispersal between neighboring stands) versions of this model to assess the role of dispersal in the landscape dynamics of outbreaks. We show that density-dependent dispersal is necessary to generate cyclic outbreaks in the spatially-implicit version of the model. The spatially-explicit FIRF model with local and stochastic dispersal displays cyclic outbreaks at the landscape scale and patchy outbreaks in space, even without density-dependence. Our simple, process-based FIRF model reproduces large scale outbreaks and can provide an innovative approach to model and manage forest pests at the landscape scale.},

abstract = {Ecological communities characteristically contain a wide diversity of species with important functional, economic and aesthetic value. Ecologists have long questioned how this diversity is maintained. Classic theory shows that stable coexistence requires competitors to differ in their niches; this has motivated numerous investigations of ecological differences presumed to maintain diversity. That niche differences are key to coexistence, however, has recently been challenged by the neutral theory of biodiversity, which explains coexistence with the equivalence of competitors. The ensuing controversy has motivated calls for a better understanding of the collective importance of niche differences for the diversity observed in ecological communities. Here we integrate theory and experimentation to show that niche differences collectively stabilize the dynamics of experimental communities of serpentine annual plants. We used field-parameterized population models to develop a null expectation for community dynamics without the stabilizing effects of niche differences. The population growth rates predicted by this null model varied by several orders of magnitude between species, which is sufficient for rapid competitive exclusion. Moreover, after two generations of community change in the field, Shannon diversity was over 50 per cent greater in communities stabilized by niche differences relative to those exhibiting dynamics predicted by the null model. Finally, in an experiment manipulating species' relative abundances, population growth rates increased when species became rare--the demographic signature of niche differences. Our work thus provides strong evidence that species differences have a critical role in stabilizing species diversity.},

abstract = {As a matter of fact, Araucaria angustifolia populations occur predominately in small and isolated stands; only a minor number of continuous natural forests of this dioecious wind-pollinated coniferous tree species remain. To implement reasonable conservation, breeding and restorations program it is necessary to have the knowledge of pollen dispersal distance and fine-scale genetic structure. In this paper, levels and dispersion distance of pollen and spatial genetic structure of A.¬†angustifolia were investigated in a 14¬†ha transect in a continuous forest in Paran√° State, Brazil. Analyses have been performed by the use of eight microsatellite loci, paternity and TwoGener approaches, and spatial autocorrelation analysis. In transect, 52 male and 56 female adult trees were mapped and genotyped, together with 190 seeds. In the present transect, A.¬†angustifolia show spatial genetic structure at distances up to 75¬†m. Paternity analysis indicated that 54{\%} of seeds were fertilized by pollen from trees outside the transect. The calculated average pollination distance within transect was 102 and 98¬†m based on the paternity analysis and TwoGener analysis, respectively. We found a significant pollen gene pool structure across seed-trees ( Formula Not Shown , P¬†{\textless}¬†0.01) that corresponds to an effective number of pollen donors of 6.4 male trees or an effective pollination neighbourhood area (A ep ) of 2.1¬†ha. The findings suggest long-distance pollen dispersion ({\textgreater}100¬†m) inside the continuous forest. However, the high proportion occurs in short-distance producing biparental and correlated mating as well as reducing the variance effective size.},

abstract = {Premise of the study: Pollination patterns determine the reproductive neighborhood size of plants, the connectivity of populations, and the impacts of habitat fragmentation. We characterized pollination in three populations of Quercus macrocarpa occurring in a highly altered landscape in northeastern Illinois to determine whether isolated remnant stands were reproductively isolated. Methods: We used microsatellites to genotype all adults and 787 acorns from two isolated savanna remnants and a stand in an old-growth forest. One isolated remnant occurred in a highly urbanized/industrialized landscape, and one occurred in an agricultural landscape. Parentage assignment was used to assess pollen-mediated gene flow. Key results: Pollen donors from outside the study sites accounted for between 46{\%} and 53{\%} of paternities and did not differ significantly among sites, indicating that similar high levels of gene flow occurred at all three sites. Within stands, the mean pollination distance ranged from 42 to 70 meters, and when accounting for outside pollinations, mean pollination distances were well over 100 meters. Genetic diversity of incoming pollen was extremely high in all three stands. The number of effective pollen donors, Nep, calculated from paternity assignment was higher than that estimated by an indirect correlated paternity approach. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that extremely isolated stands of oaks are unlikely to be genetically and reproductively isolated, and remnant stands may contribute to maintaining genetic connectivity in highly modified landscapes. {\textcopyright} 2010 Botanical Society of America.},

abstract = {The notion of 'community-wide character displacement' hypothesizes that locally co-existing sets of competing species should be less similar than expected when compared to random expectations from a broader regional species pool. Here I use a mechanistic approach to the niche concept to show how this expectation is dependent on the types of traits involved. I investigate how two different niche components, those that relate to species' requirements (or responses to environmental factors) versus those that relate to species' impacts (or effects on environmental factors), affect predictions about the similarity of locally co-existing species. In contrast with more conventional approaches that focus on species impacts, I focus on species responses to conclude that locally co-existing species should be more similar in such traits than expected on the basis of random asortment from a larger equilibrium regional biota. In addition, I explore the evolutionary implications of exceptions that might favour the co-existence of species with dissimilar traits (especially those that determine species' impacts on the environment) and conclude that these implications differ when species compete for shared resources, interact via shared predators, or interact via both mechanisms. The analysis developed in this paper shows that the co-existence of species that are more similar than expected by chance is not incompatible with the notion of strongly interacting species in saturated local communities near equilibrium.},

abstract = {Context: Climate change will have diverse and interacting effects on forests over the next century. One of the most pronounced effects may be a decline in resistance to chronic change and resilience to acute disturbances. The capacity for forests to persist and/or adapt to climate change remains largely unknown, in part because there is not broad agreement how to measure and apply resilience concepts. Objectives: We assessed the interactions of climate change, resistance, resilience, diversity, and alternative management of northern Great Lake forests. Methods: We simulated two landscapes (northern Minnesota and northern lower Michigan), three climate futures (current climate, a low emissions trajectory, and a high emissions trajectory), and four management regimes [business as usual, expanded forest reserves, modified silviculture, and climate suitable planting (CSP)]. We simulated each scenario with a forest landscape simulation model. We assessed resistance as the change in species composition over time. We assessed resilience and calculated an index of resilience that incorporated both recovery of pre-fire tree species composition and aboveground biomass within simulated burned areas. Results: Results indicate a positive relationship between diversity and resistance within low diversity areas. Simulations of the high emission climate future resulted in a decline in both resistance and resilience. Conclusions: Of the management regimes, the CSP regime resulted in some of the greatest resilience under climate change although our results suggest that differences in forest management are largely outweighed by the effects of climate change. Our results provide a framework for assessing resistance and resilience relevant and valuable to a broad array of ecological systems.},

abstract = {Manipulating the overstorey is the key tool for forest managers to steer natural regeneration. Opening up the canopy does not only create favourable light conditions for tree seedling growth, but also for (competitive) understorey species. Therefore, a thorough understanding of how changes in the abundance of the overstorey and understorey influence tree regeneration is needed to attain successful regeneration. To this end, we used the regional Flemish Forest Inventories, which contain vegetation plots that were surveyed at two times and include large variation in species composition and abundance of both overstorey and understorey layers. These plots were classified into poor and rich forest types, which differ in overstorey and understorey species composition and soil fertility. For each forest type, we first investigated the effect of overstorey abundance and shade-casting ability on the understorey herbaceous vegetation cover and its competitive nature. Then, we modelled how both these strata influence the presence-absence as well as the cover of tree regeneration, using the zero-inflated beta distribution. Our results show that the understorey cover and its competitiveness mainly increase when the abundance and shade-casting ability of the overstorey is reduced. The shade-casting ability of the overstorey and competitiveness of the understorey were more important in determining tree regeneration, especially probability of presence, than the abundance of these layers per se. This was consistent for both forest types, although directions and magnitudes of the effects differed. In predictions mimicking several thinning scenarios we found that in the poor forests, reducing overstorey abundance could lead to an increase in seedling cover, whereas in rich forests, the opposite is true and seedling cover will potentially be reduced. Finally, in a single-species analysis focusing on Quercus, we found a trade-off between sufficiently reducing overstorey abundance, while at the same retaining parent trees as potential seed sources. These findings can be used to guide forest management decisions in order to attain successful forest regeneration in temperate forests.},

abstract = {The rapid expansion of next-generation sequencing has yielded a powerful array of tools to address fundamental biological questions at a scale that was inconceivable just a few years ago. Various genome-partitioning strategies to sequence select subsets of the genome have emerged as powerful alternatives to whole-genome sequencing in ecological and evolutionary genomic studies. High-throughput targeted capture is one such strategy that involves the parallel enrichment of preselected genomic regions of interest. The growing use of targeted capture demonstrates its potential power to address a range of research questions, yet these approaches have yet to expand broadly across laboratories focused on evolutionary and ecological genomics. In part, the use of targeted capture has been hindered by the logistics of capture design and implementation in species without established reference genomes. Here we aim to (i) increase the accessibility of targeted capture to researchers working in nonmodel taxa by discussing capture methods that circumvent the need of a reference genome, (ii) highlight the evolutionary and ecological applications where this approach is emerging as a powerful sequencing strategy and (III) discuss the future of targeted capture and other genome-partitioning approaches in the light of the increasing accessibility of whole-genome sequencing. Given the practical advantages and increasing feasibility of high-throughput targeted capture, we anticipate an ongoing expansion of capture-based approaches in evolutionary and ecological research, synergistic with an expansion of whole-genome sequencing.},

abstract = {Among the local processes that determine species diversity in ecological communities, fluctuation-dependent mechanisms that are mediated by temporal variability in the abundances of species populations have received significant attention. Higher temporal variability in the abundances of species populations can increase the strength of temporal niche partitioning but can also increase the risk of species extinctions, such that the net effect on species coexistence is not clear. We quantified this temporal population variability for tree species in 21 large forest plots and found much greater variability for higher latitude plots with fewer tree species. A fitted mechanistic model showed that among the forest plots, the net effect of temporal population variability on tree species coexistence was usually negative, but sometimes positive or negligible. Therefore, our results suggest that temporal variability in the abundances of species populations has no clear negative or positive contribution to the latitudinal gradient in tree species richness.},

The monoecious African fig tree Ficus sycomorus L. relies on the small, short-lived, night-flying, host-specific fig wasp Ceratosolen arabicus Mayr for pollination. We used microsatellite markers to characterize a geographically isolated riparian population of F. sycomorus growing along the Ugab River in the Namib Desert, Namibia, together with paternity analysis of seedlings from known mothers, to map pollen movement within this population. In this way we tracked insect movements between individually recognizable trees by means of their pollen cargo and documented the movement of C. arabicus between known trees separated by more than 160 km, with a mean distance for confirmed successful pollination events of 88.6 km. The predominant observed movement of pollinators was in a westerly direction, toward the sea, reflecting seasonal nighttime wind direction and the wind-borne dispersal of fig wasps. Our results suggest the existence of an extensive panmictic population of trees that are well suited to overcome the effects of geographical isolation.},

Air temperature and humidity, and soil chemistry were evaluated beneath the canopy of isolated trees of A. angustifolia, and compared with values in adjacent grassland areas and under the canopy of the shrub Baccharis uncinella. Milder summer temperatures and vapour pressure deficits were measured under Araucaria and Baccharis compared with open grassland. There were also ameliorating effects on soil chemistry under individuals of these two species, but these were more pronounced for Araucaria than for Baccharis. The results suggest that the large number of seedlings commonly found beneath the canopy of Araucaria is due not only to perching, but also to nursing, through the amelioration of environmental conditions.},

Here, we developed a 3D individual-based model called FLORSYS predicting growth and development of annual weeds and crops as a function of daily weather and cropping practices: (1) crop emergence is driven by temperature, and emerged plants are placed onto the 3D field map, depending on sowing pattern, density, and emergence rate; plants are described as cylinders with their leaf area distributed according to height; (2) weed emergence is predicted by an existing submodel, emerged weed seedlings are placed randomly: (3) plant phenology depends on temperature; (4) a previously developed submodel predicts available light in each voxel of the canopy; after emergence, plant growth is driven by temperature; when shaded, biomass accumulation results from the difference between photosynthesis and respiration; shading causes etiolation; (5) frost reduces biomass and destroys plants, (6) at plant maturity, the newly produced seeds are added to the soil seed bank. The model was used to test different sowing scenarios in an oilseed rape/winter wheat/winter barley rotation with sixteen weed annuals, showing that (1) crop yield loss was negatively correlated to weed biomass averaged over the cropping season; (2) weed biomass was decreased by scenarios allowing early and homogenous crop canopy closure (e.g. reduced interrows, increased sowing density, associated or undersown crops), increased summer fatal weed seed germination (e.g. delayed sowing) or, to a lesser degree, cleaner fields at cash crop sowing (e.g. sowing a temporary cover crop for "catching" nitrogen); (3) the scenario effect depended on weed species (e.g. climbing species were little affected by increased crop competition), and the result thus varied with the initial weed community (e.g. communities dominated by small weed species were hindered by the faster emergence of broadcast-sown crops whereas taller species profited by the more frequent gap canopies); (4) the effect on weed biomass of sowing scenarios applied to one year was still visible up to ten years later, and the beneficial effect during the test year could be followed by detrimental effects later (e.g. the changed tillage dates accompanying catch crops reduced weed emergence in the immediately following cash crop but increased seed survival and thus infestation of the subsequent crops). This simulation showed FLORSYS to predict realistic potential crop yields, and the simulated impact of crop scenarios was consistent with literature reports.},

Before the ice storm, most microsites received between 2 and 4{\%}PPFD. Following the ice storm, the stand-level mean {\%}PPFD increased four- to five-fold, ranging from 13.8 to 20.5{\%}PPFD, from 0.3 to 4 m aboveground. Despite its magnitude, the post-ice storm increase in light transmission was short-lived. By 1999 (2-year+), the mean light levels had decreased by half, and recovery to pre-storm conditions occurred within 3-7 years, depending on height. The decrease in light transmission during the post-disturbance years followed an inverse J-shape trend, indicating more dynamic changes early after disturbance. By 2004 (7-year+), light levels at ???2 m had become slightly but significantly lower than before the ice storm, with most microsites receiving {\textless}2{\%}PPFD. The ice storm led to a synchronized increase of the light levels at almost all understory locations, which might allow a high proportion of the advanced regeneration to experience a release. However, due to the rapid recovery of the light conditions to levels similar or lower than before the ice storm, this disturbance should be more advantageous to shade-tolerant species. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Understanding the role of competition in structuring communities requires that we quantify competitive ability in a way that permits us to predict the outcome of competition over the long term. Given such a clear goal for a process that has been the focus of ecological research for decades, there is surprisingly little consensus on how to measure competitive ability, with up to 50 different metrics currently proposed. Using competitive population dynamics as a foundation, we define competitive ability-the ability of one species to exclude another-using quantitative theoretical models of population dynamics to isolate the key parameters that are known to predict competitive outcomes. Based on the definition of competitive ability we identify the empirical requirements and describe straightforward methods for quantifying competitive ability in future empirical studies. In doing so, our analysis also allows us to identify why many existing approaches to studying competition are unsuitable for quantifying competitive ability. Synthesis. Competitive ability is precisely defined starting from models of competitive population dynamics. Quantifying competitive ability in a theoretically justified manner is straightforward using experimental designs readily applied to studies of competition in the laboratory and field.},

abstract = {Abstract Predicting which ecological factors constrain species distributions is a fundamental ecological question and critical to forecasting geographic responses to global change. Darwin hypothesised that abiotic factors generally impose species' high-latitude and high-elevation (typically cool) range limits, whereas biotic interactions more often impose species' low-latitude/low-elevation (typically warm) limits, but empirical support has been mixed. Here, we clarify three predictions arising from Darwin's hypothesis and show that previously mixed support is partially due to researchers testing different predictions. Using a comprehensive literature review (885 range limits), we find that biotic interactions, including competition, predation and parasitism, contributed to {\textgreater}60{\%} of range limits and influenced species' warm limits more often than cool limits. Abiotic factors contributed more often than biotic interactions to cool range limits, but temperature contributed frequently to both cool and warm limits. Our results suggest that most range limits will be sensitive to climate warming, but warm-limit responses in particular will depend strongly on biotic interactions.},

abstract = {Aim To define biome-scale hotspots of phylogenetic and functional mammalian biodiversity (PD and FD, respectively) and compare them with ‘classical' hotspots based on species richness (SR) alone. Location Global. Methods SR, PD and FD were computed for 782 terrestrial ecoregions using the distribution ranges of 4616 mammalian species. We used a set of comprehensive diversity indices unified by a recent framework incorporating the relative species coverage in each ecoregion. We built large-scale multifaceted diversity–area relationships to rank ecoregions according to their levels of biodiversity while accounting for the effect of area on each facet of diversity. Finally we defined hotspots as the top-ranked ecoregions. Results While ignoring relative species coverage led to a fairly good congruence between biome-scale top ranked SR, PD and FD hotspots, ecoregions harbouring a rich and abundantly represented evolutionary history and FD did not match with the top-ranked ecoregions defined by SR. More importantly PD and FD hotspots showed important spatial mismatches. We also found that FD and PD generally reached their maximum values faster than SR as a function of area. Main conclusions The fact that PD/FD reach their maximum value faster than SR could suggest that the two former facets might be less vulnerable to habitat loss than the latter. While this point is expected, it is the first time that it has been quantified at a global scale and should have important consequences for conservation. Incorporating relative species coverage into the delineation of multifaceted hotspots of diversity led to weak congruence between SR, PD and FD hotspots. This means that maximizing species number may fail to preserve those nodes (in the phylogenetic or functional tree) that are relatively abundant in the ecoregion. As a consequence it may be of prime importance to adopt a multifaceted biodiversity perspective to inform conservation strategies at a global scale.},

abstract = {Abstract Bayesian inference is an important statistical tool that is increasingly being used by ecologists. In a Bayesian analysis, information available before a study is conducted is summarized in a quantitative model or hypothesis: the prior probability distribution. Bayes' Theorem uses the prior probability distribution and the likelihood of the data to generate a posterior probability distribution. Posterior probability distributions are an epistemological alternative to P-values and provide a direct measure of the degree of belief that can be placed on models, hypotheses, or parameter estimates. Moreover, Bayesian information-theoretic methods provide robust measures of the probability of alternative models, and multiple models can be averaged into a single model that reflects uncertainty in model construction and selection. These methods are demonstrated through a simple worked example. Ecologists are using Bayesian inference in studies that range from predicting single-species population dynamics to understanding ecosystem processes. Not all ecologists, however, appreciate the philosophical underpinnings of Bayesian inference. In particular, Bayesians and frequentists differ in their definition of probability and in their treatment of model parameters as random variables or estimates of true values. These assumptions must be addressed explicitly before deciding whether or not to use Bayesian methods to analyse ecological data.},

abstract = {Dynamic Vegetation Models (DVMs) are designed to be suitable for simulating forest succession and species range dynamics under current and future conditions based on mathematical representations of the three key processes regeneration, growth, and mortality. However, mortality formulations in DVMs are typically coarse and often lack an empirical basis, which increases the uncertainty of projections of future forest dynamics and hinders their use for developing adaptation strategies to climate change. Thus, sound tree mortality models are highly needed. We developed parsimonious, species-specific mortality models for 18 European tree species using {\textgreater}90,000 records from inventories in Swiss and German strict forest reserves along a considerable environmental gradient. We comprehensively evaluated model performance and incorporated the new mortality functions in the dynamic forest model ForClim. Tree mortality was successfully predicted by tree size and growth. Only a few species required additional covariates in their final model to consider aspects of stand structure or climate. The relationships between mortality and its predictors reflect the indirect influences of resource availability and tree vitality, which are further shaped by species-specific attributes such as maximum longevity and shade tolerance. Considering that the behavior of the models was biologically meaningful, and that their performance was reasonably high and not impacted by changes in the sampling design, we suggest that the mortality algorithms developed here are suitable for implementation and evaluation in DVMs. In the DVM ForClim, the new mortality functions resulted in simulations of stand basal area and species composition that were generally close to historical observations. However, ForClim performance was poorer than when using the original, coarse mortality formulation. The difficulties of simulating stand structure and species composition, which were most evident for Fagus sylvatica L. and in long-term simulations, resulted from feedbacks between simulated growth and mortality as well as from extrapolation to very small and very large trees. Growth and mortality processes and their species-specific differences should thus be revisited jointly, with a particular focus on small and very large trees in relation to their shade tolerance.},

abstract = {Projected changes in temperature and drought regime are likely to reduce carbon (C) storage in forests, thereby amplifying rates of climate change. While such reductions are often presumed to be greatest in semi-arid forests that experience widespread tree mortality, the consequences of drought may also be important in temperate mesic forests of Eastern North America (ENA) if tree growth is significantly curtailed by drought. Investigations of the environmental conditions that determine drought sensitivity are critically needed to accurately predict ecosystem feedbacks to climate change. We matched site factors with the growth responses to drought of 10,753 trees across mesic forests of ENA, representing 24 species and 346 stands, to determine the broad-scale drivers of drought sensitivity for the dominant trees in ENA. Here we show that two factors—the timing of drought, and the atmospheric demand for water (i.e., local potential evapotranspiration; PET)—are stronger drivers of drought sensitivity than soil and stand characteristics. Drought-induced reductions in tree growth were greatest when the droughts occurred during early-season peaks in radial growth, especially for trees growing in the warmest, driest regions (i.e., highest PET). Further, mean species trait values (rooting depth and $\psi$50) were poor predictors of drought sensitivity, as intraspecific variation in sensitivity was equal to or greater than interspecific variation in 17 of 24 species. From a general circulation model ensemble, we find that future increases in early-season PET may exacerbate these effects, and potentially offset gains in C uptake and storage in ENA owing to other global change factors.},

abstract = {Forecasting ecological responses to climate change, invasion, and their interaction must rely on understanding underlying mechanisms. However, such forecasts require extrapolation into new locations and environments. We linked demography and environment using experimental biogeography to forecast invasive and native species' potential ranges under present and future climate in New England, United States to overcome issues of extrapolation in novel environments. We studied two potentially nonequilibrium invasive plants' distributions, Alliaria petiolata (garlic mustard) and Berberis thunbergii (Japanese barberry), each paired with their native ecological analogs to better understand demographic drivers of invasions. Our models predict that climate change will considerably reduce establishment of a currently prolific invader (A. petiolata) throughout New England driven by poor demographic performance in warmer climates. In contrast, invasion of B. thunbergii will be facilitated because of higher growth and germination in warmer climates, with higher likelihood to establish farther north and in closed canopy habitats in the south. Invasion success is in high fecundity for both invasive species and demographic compensation for Apetiolata relative to native analogs. For A. petiolata, simulations suggest that eradication efforts would require unrealistic efficiency; hence, management should focus on inhibiting spread into colder, currently unoccupied areas, understanding source-sink dynamics, and understanding community dynamics should A. petiolata (which is allelopathic) decline. Our results-based on considerable differences with correlative occurrence models typically used for such biogeographic forecasts-suggest the urgency of incorporating mechanism into range forecasting and invasion management to understand how climate change may alter current invasion patterns.},

Twelve populations were collected across an altitudinal gradient (1650-2520 m above sea level [asl]) in a mountainous zone in the central-west region of the Mexican Trans-Volcanic Belt, and were planted in common garden tests at three forest sites of different altitudes (low: 2110, medium: 2422 and upper: 2746 m asl). Climate was estimated using a spline climatic model at the seed source and test sites and also measured using in situ data loggers. Survivorship and seedling height were evaluated in the field during the second and third growing seasons. Results were analyzed using mixed models to include the effect of climatic transfer distances (difference in climate between seed source and test site). Significant differences were found in seedling growth among Pinus devoniana, P. pseudostrobus and P. leiophylla, and among populations within the former two species. These were associated primarily with climatic transfer distances of extreme temperatures (minimum temperature in the coldest month and mean temperature in the warmest month). There was a significant decrease in growth in P. devoniana when the transfer exceeded 650 m of upward altitudinal shift or a reduction of 1.58C with transfer to colder sites. There was also a decrease of growth in P. pseudostrobus when transfer exceeded 400 m of upward altitudinal shift or 1.58C, with a significant decrease in survivorship. Pinus leiophylla, however, exhibited similar growth at all altitudes tested, probably due to phenotypic plasticity. Although further research is required with field tests using commercial spacing and trees of older ages, the results suggest that an assisted upwards migration of 300 m in altitude, in order to approach a realignment of the populations to the climate projected for the decade centered around the year 2030, appears to be a viable strategy with which to accommodate the effects of climate change.},

abstract = {Biological invasions, including infectious disease out-breaks and biocontrol introductions, often involve small numbers of individuals arriving in spatially heterogeneous environments. Small numbers lead to demographic stochasticity, and spatial heterogeneity means that establishment success depends critically on the intro-duction sites and movement patterns of invaders. We present a gen-eral stochastic modeling framework to address how spatial hetero-geneity and movement patterns determine establishment success, population growth, and rates of spatial spread. For dispersal-limited populations, our analysis reveals that spatial heterogeneity increases the expected population growth rate and that local reproductive numbers determine establishment success. Higher dispersal rates de-crease the expected population growth rate but can enhance establishment success, particularly when movement patterns are positively correlated with local reproductive numbers. We also find that several small, randomly distributed propagules of invaders are more likely to succeed than a single large propagule. Even if invasions are ul-timately successful, there may be substantial time lags before an invader reaches observable densities. These time lags are longer for invasions into patches where extinction risk is high and in landscapes where metapopulation-scale population growth rate is low, while the opposite holds true for rates of spatial spread. Sensitivity analysis of our models provides guidance for control efforts. {\textcopyright} 2009 by The University of Chicago.},

abstract = {Species distribution models (SDMs) are widely used to explain and predict species ranges and environmental niches. They are most commonly constructed by inferring species' occurrence–environment relationships using statistical and machine-learning methods. The variety of methods that can be used to construct SDMs (e.g. generalized linear/additive models, tree-based models, maximum entropy, etc.), and the variety of ways that such models can be implemented, permits substantial flexibility in SDM complexity. Building models with an appropriate amount of complexity for the study objectives is critical for robust inference. We characterize complexity as the shape of the inferred occurrence–environment relationships and the number of parameters used to describe them, and search for insights into whether additional complexity is informative or superfluous. By building ‘under fit' models, having insufficient flexibility to describe observed occurrence–environment relationships, we risk misunderstanding the factors shaping species distributions. By building ‘over fit' models, with excessive flexibility, we risk inadvertently ascribing pattern to noise or building opaque models. However, model selection can be challenging, especially when comparing models constructed under different modeling approaches. Here we argue for a more pragmatic approach: researchers should constrain the complexity of their models based on study objective, attributes of the data, and an understanding of how these interact with the underlying biological processes. We discuss guidelines for balancing under fitting with over fitting and consequently how complexity affects decisions made during model building. Although some generalities are possible, our discussion reflects differences in opinions that favor simpler versus more complex models. We conclude that combining insights from both simple and complex SDM building approaches best advances our knowledge of current and future species ranges.},

Species distribution models (SDMs) are typically based on correlations between species occurrence data and environmental predictors, with ecological processes captured only implicitly. However, there is a growing interest in approaches that explicitly model processes such as physiology, dispersal, demography and biotic interactions. These models are believed to offer more robust predictions, particularly when extrapolating to novel conditions. Many process–explicit approaches are now available, but it is not clear how we can best draw on this expanded modelling toolbox to address ecological problems and inform management decisions. Here, we review a range of process–explicit models to determine their strengths and limitations, as well as their current use. Focusing on four common applications of SDMs – regulatory planning, extinction risk, climate refugia and invasive species – we then explore which models best meet management needs. We identify barriers to more widespread and effective use of process-explicit models and outline how these might be overcome. As well as technical and data challenges, there is a pressing need for more thorough evaluation of model predictions to guide investment in method development and ensure the promise of these new approaches is fully realised.},

abstract = {Aims: A common assumption in ecology is that where a species is found to be most abundant must correspond to the environmental context in which the species performs the best (i.e. optimal niche space). This assumption is central to common conservation and management tools such as habitat suitability assessment and species distribution modeling. I test this hypothesis. Methods: I use the US Forest Inventory Assessment data for the abundance of trees across eastern North America. I use the FORAST tree-ring dataset for ontogenetic growth rate (tree-ring increment), a measure of niche performance and correlated with intrinsic rate of increase, r. Important Findings: I find that across 15 species, there are significantly more negative correlations than expected by chance. This negative correlation between abundance and performance across space contradicts common assumptions but is consistent with an inclusive niche structuring of the community. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Author.

abstract = {This research was aimed at understanding how far and how fast glyphosate-resistant (GR) Palmer amaranth will spread in cotton and the consequences associated with allowing a single plant to escape control. Specifically, research was conducted to determine the collective impact of seed dispersal agents on the in-field expansion of GR Palmer amaranth, and any resulting yield reductions in an enhanced GR cotton system where glyphosate was solely used for weed control. Introduction of 20,000 GR Palmer amaranth seed into a 1-m2 circle in February 2008 was used to represent survival through maturity of a single GR female Palmer amaranth escape from the 2007 growing season. The experiment was conducted in four different cotton fields (0.53 to 0.77 ha in size) with no history of Palmer amaranth infestation. In the subsequent year, Palmer amaranth was located as far as 114 m downslope, creating a separate patch. It is believed that rainwater dispersed the seeds from the original area of introduction. In less than 2 yr after introduction, GR Palmer amaranth expanded to the boundaries of all fields, infesting over 20{\%} of the total field area. Spatial regression estimates indicated that no yield penalty was associated with Palmer amaranth density the first year after introduction, which is not surprising since only 0.56{\%} of the field area was infested with GR Palmer amaranth in 2008. Lint yield reductions as high as 17 kg ha−1 were observed 2 yr after the introduction (in 2009). Three years after the introduction (2010), Palmer amaranth infested 95 to 100{\%} of the area in all fields, resulting in complete crop loss since it was impossible to harvest the crop. These results indicate that resistance management options such as a “zero-tolerance threshold” should be used in managing or mitigating the spread of GR Palmer amaranth. This research demonstrates the need for proactive resistance management.},

abstract = {Paternity inference using highly polymorphic codominant markers is becoming common in the study of natural populations. However, multiple males are often found to be genetically compatible with each offspring tested, even when the probability of excluding an unrelated male is high. While various methods exist for evaluating the likelihood of paternity of each nonexcluded male, interpreting these likelihoods has hitherto been difficult, and no method takes account of the incomplete sampling and error-prone genetic data typical of large-scale studies of natural systems. We derive likelihood ratios for paternity inference with codominant markers taking account of typing error, and define a statistic A for resolving paternity. Using allele frequencies from the study population in question, a simulation program generates criteria for A that permit assignment of paternity to the most likely male with a known level of statistical confidence. The simulation takes account of the number of candidate males, the proportion of males that are sampled and gaps and errors in genetic data. We explore the potentially confounding effect of relatives and show that the method is robust to their presence under commonly encountered conditions. The method is demonstrated using genetic data from the intensively studied red deer (Cervus elaphus) population on the island of Rum, Scotland. The Windows-based computer program, CERVUS+, described in this study is available from the authors. CERVUS can be used to calculate allele frequencies, run simulations and perform parentage analysis using data from all types of codominant markers.},

abstract = {In their natural environment, plants interact with many different organisms. The nature of these interactions may range from positive, for example interactions with pollinators, to negative, such as interactions with pathogens and herbivores. In this special issue, the contributors provide several examples of how plants manage both positive and negative biotic interactions. This review aims to relate their findings to what we know about the complex natural environments in which plants have evolved. Molecular analyses of plant genomes and expression profiles have shown how intricately plants may regulate responses to single or multiple biotic interactions. Plant responses are fine-tuned by signalling hormone interactions. When multiple organisms interact with a single plant this may result in antagonistic or synergistic effects. The emerging fields of ecogenomics and metabolomics undoubtedly will refine our understanding of the multilayered regulation that plants use to manage relationships with their biotic environment. However, we can only understand why plants have such an intricate regulatory apparatus if we consider the ecological context of plant biotic interactions.},

abstract = {A central tenet of ecology and biogeography is that the broad outlines of species ranges are determined by climate, whereas the effects of biotic interactions are manifested at local scales. While the first proposition is supported by ample evidence, the second is still a matter of controversy. To address this question, we develop a mathematical model that predicts the spatial overlap, i.e. co-occurrence, between pairs of species subject to all possible types of interactions. We then identify the scale of resolution in which predicted range overlaps are lost. We found that co-occurrence arising from positive interactions, such as mutualism (+/+) and commensalism (+/0), are manifested across scales. Negative interactions, such as competition (-/-) and amensalism (-/0), generate checkerboard patterns of co-occurrence that are discernible at finer resolutions but that are lost and increasing scales of resolution. Scale dependence in consumer-resource interactions (+/-) depends on the strength of positive dependencies between species. If the net positive effect is greater than the net negative effect, then interactions scale up similarly to positive interactions. Our results challenge the widely held view that climate alone is sufficient to characterize species distributions at broad scales, but also demonstrate that the spatial signature of competition is unlikely to be discernible beyond local and regional scales. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.},

abstract = {Frugivorous animals frequently generate clumped distributions of seeds away from source trees via 'destination-based' dispersal processes. For example, use of traditional sleeping trees by white-bellied spider monkeys Ateles belzebuth generates high densities of seeds of a preferred food source, the palm Oenocarpus bataua, at these sites. Little is known about the maternal seed source diversity and population genetic metrics of seed pools encountered at these sites. Given the repeated use of sleeping trees over time, and the fluid social organization and wide ranging movements exhibited by spider monkeys, we predicted that O. bataua seed pools beneath sleeping trees would be characterized by relatively high values of maternal seed source diversity and standard metrics of genetic diversity. Contrary to these expectations, we found relatively low average maternal seed source diversity beneath each of 6 sleeping trees we studied (weighted mean ?? = 3.74), but considerable variation in diversity of maternal seed sources between sleeping trees (range = 1.75-10.1) and high heterogeneity in standard genetic diversity measures between sleeping trees. There was no evidence for overlap in maternal seed sources between sleeping tree sites (?? = 1.0), resulting in significant genetic differentiation (Fst = 0.055-0.319) between these sites. Observed variation between sleeping trees could not be explained by the number of individual spider monkeys whose core home ranges included a given tree, nor by distance to a central mineral lick, a focal point of spider monkey activity. These findings suggest that spider monkey seed dispersal to sleeping trees is spatially restricted, perhaps because the animals visit sleeping trees at the end of the day and therefore only disperse O. bataua fruits that they ingest late in the day. These results add to our growing appreciation of the ways frugivore behavior mechanistically shapes seed dispersal outcomes.},

abstract = {There is empirical evidence that landscape composition and structure can affect the distribution and long-term dynamics of the organisms that live in it. Weeds are no exception and in this paper, we investigated how weed richness and diversity in 123 winter wheat fields within a small agricultural region were affected by the landscape surrounding each field (radii ranging from 100 to 1000. m) and the field properties such as its size and the preceding crop. Landscape was described by its proportion (cover of spring crops, winter crops, woodland, grassland, set-aside) and its structure (number of fields, number of land use types). Aka??ke criterion-based models indicated that variations in weeds were best explained at the 200. m radius. At that scale, hierarchical partitioning shows that the independent contributions of field level and landscape level variables were significant for two variables. Weed richness and weed diversity increased significantly as field size decreased and as the number of fields within 200. m increased. This suggests that weed richness and diversity are higher in landscapes that have a finer grain, probably because these landscapes offer more habitat heterogeneity within cultivated areas and contain more crop edges that can shelter many weed species. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {1. Despite being instrumental in forest ecology, the definition and nature of shade tolerance are complex and not beyond controversy. Moreover, the role it plays in the trait–demography relationship remains unclear. 2. Here, we hypothesize that shade tolerance can be achieved by alternative combinations of traits depending on the species' functional group (evergreen vs. deciduous species) and that its ability to explain the array of traits involved in demography will also vary between these two groups. 3. We used dimension reduction to identify the main trait spectra for 48 tree species, including 23 evergreens and 25 deciduous – dispersed across 21 genera and 13 families. We assessed the relationship between functional traits, shade tolerance, and demographic performance at high and low light using structural equation modelling. 4. The dimensions found corresponded to the trait spectra previously observed in the literature and were significantly related to measures of demography. However, our results support the existence of a divergence between evergreen and deciduous species in the way shade tolerance relates to the demography of species along light gradients. 5. We show that shade tolerance can be attained through different combination of traits depending on the functional and geographical context, and thus, its utilization as a predictor of forest dynamics and species coexistence requires previous knowledge on the role it plays in the demographic performance of the species under study.},

abstract = {Plant invasions are a threat to rangelands in California. Understanding how seeds of invasive plants are dispersed is critical to developing sound management plans. Domestic livestock can transport seeds long distances by ingesting and passing seeds in dung (endozoochory) or by the attachment of seeds to skin and fur (epizoochory). Our objective was to characterize the role of cattle as seed dispersers of both invasive and noninvasive species via endozoochory and epizoochory in a Sierra foothills rangeland. To quantify endozoochory, we sampled dung from two dry-season grazing periods and evaluated seed content by growing dung for 3 months in a greenhouse. To quantify epizoochory, we collected seeds directly from the fur of 40 cattle. We categorized the invasion status and functional groups of all species found and quantified landscape-scale vegetation composition in order to determine whether dispersal mode was associated with functional group, invasion status, or vegetation composition. Finally, we evaluated the potential for the noxious weed medusahead (Taeniatherum caput-medusae [L.] Nevski) to travel long distances on cattle fur using a detachment experiment with a model cow. We found that forbs were more likely to be dispersed by endozoochory, and invasive species were more likely to be dispersed by epizoochory. Medusahead was dispersed exclusively by epizoochory and was able to travel up to 160 m on a model cow. Our results suggest that cattle may be an important dispersal vector for both invasive and noninvasive plants.},

abstract = {Ecological theory is essential to predict the effects of global changes such as habitat loss and fragmentation on biodiversity. Species–area relationships (SAR), metapopulation models (MEP) and species distribution models (SDM) are commonly used tools incorporating different ecological processes to explain biodiversity distribution and dynamics. Yet few studies have compared the outcomes of these disparate models and investigated their complementarity. Here we show that the processes underlying SAR (patch area), MEP (patch isolation) and SDM (environmental conditions) models can be compared with a common statistical framework. Our approach allows for species and community-level predictions under current and future landscape scenarios, facilitates multi-model comparison and provides the machinery for integrating multiple mechanisms into one model. We apply this framework to the distribution of eight focal vertebrate species in current and future projected landscapes where 10{\%} of the landscape is lost to land-use change in southwestern, Quebec, Canada. Based on a model selection approach, we found that a model including patch area was the top ranked model for four of our focal species and models including patch isolation and environmental conditions were the top ranked models for two focal species each. Community-level predictions of models based on patch area, patch isolation and environmental conditions for both current and future landscapes showed high spatial overlap, however, patch area models always predicted a reduction of species richness per patch whereas both the patch isolation and environmental conditions models predicted an increase or decrease in species richness per patch following habitat loss and fragmentation. Our comparative tool will allow ecologists and conservation practitioners to relate structural uncertainty to key mechanisms underlying each model. Ultimately, this approach is one step in the direction of deriving robust predictions for the change and loss of biodiversity under global change, which is key for informing conservation plans.},

Canopy mortality increased by +2.40{\%} year–1, doubling the forest area affected by mortality since 1984.

abstract = {Since shifts in altitudinal range are expected in response to climate change, we explored the effect on survivorship and growth of moving populations of three Mexican pine species (Pinus devoniana, P. leiophylla and P. pseudostrobus) to higher altitude, aiming to realign the populations to projected future climates in an experimental assisted migration. Twelve populations were collected across an altitudinal gradient (1650-2520 m above sea level [asl]) in a mountainous zone in the central-west region of the Mexican Trans-Volcanic Belt, and were planted in common garden tests at three forest sites of different altitudes (low: 2110, medium: 2422 and upper: 2746 m asl). Climate was estimated using a spline climatic model at the seed source and test sites and also measured using in situ data loggers. Survivorship and seedling height were evaluated in the field during the second and third growing seasons. Results were analyzed using mixed models to include the effect of climatic transfer distances (difference in climate between seed source and test site). Significant differences were found in seedling growth among Pinus devoniana, P. pseudostrobus and P. leiophylla, and among populations within the former two species. These were associated primarily with climatic transfer distances of extreme temperatures (minimum temperature in the coldest month and mean temperature in the warmest month). There was a significant decrease in growth in P. devoniana when the transfer exceeded 650 m of upward altitudinal shift or a reduction of 1.58C with transfer to colder sites. There was also a decrease of growth in P. pseudostrobus when transfer exceeded 400 m of upward altitudinal shift or 1.58C, with a significant decrease in survivorship. Pinus leiophylla, however, exhibited similar growth at all altitudes tested, probably due to phenotypic plasticity. Although further research is required with field tests using commercial spacing and trees of older ages, the results suggest that an assisted upwards migration of 300 m in altitude, in order to approach a realignment of the populations to the climate projected for the decade centered around the year 2030, appears to be a viable strategy with which to accommodate the effects of climate change.},

abstract = {Climate change is expected to result in a reorganization of the continental distribution of tree species. Recent shifts in distribution patterns have been reported, but it is not always clear how climate change influences these patterns locally, especially in relation to other disturbances. We investigated latitudinal shifts of four ecologically important tree species between 1970 and 2014 within a study area that encompasses their northernmost range limit in northeastern North America (Quebec, Canada; {\~{}}761,000 km2). Changes in latitudinal limits were defined in relation to changes in tree saplings' occurrence patterns within forest plots resampled over two time periods (1970–1977 and 2003–2014). By examining changes in the frequency of occurrences in different portions of the study area along a latitudinal gradient, we were able to identify spatially explicit patterns of loss or gain (sapling recruitment) resulting in the shifts observed. We then estimated the probability of observing a recruitment event in response to changes in climate, disturbance and their interaction, using a multimodel selection approach. Latitudinal limits of all four species shifted northward, but these shifts resulted from different patterns of plot occurrence changes, depending on the species and the location examined. Greater recruitment at northern locations than at southern ones drove shifts for Acer saccharum Marsh., Fagus grandifolia Ehrh. and Acer rubrum L., but less so for Betula alleghaniensis Britt. Climate variables indicating changes in early or late growing season conditions were most often selected in models. Warming tended to reduce recruitment probability in the south but increase it in the north, leading to divergent responses for a given species across the study area. Disturbance effects were generally less important than climate change effects, as was their interaction. Synthesis. Spatially explicit and divergent responses to climate change and disturbance drive recruitment patterns underlying latitudinal shifts of tree species. The importance of early- or late-season climate variables points towards biological processes being affected at critical stages of the life cycle. Understanding the factors that influence species' migration capacity in a changing climate is crucial to inform adaptive management and conservation practices.},

Archeological research reveals that groups of pottery-producing hunter-gatherers belonging to the Je linguistic stock. These are archeologically defined as the Taquara/Itarare Tradition, and occupied the highlands in southern Brazil from 2000 years BP until 200 years BP. Major resource uses regarding forest vegetation were hunting, Araucaria nuts seed harvesting (considered an essential component in the diet) and agroforestry management. Their settlements, known as casas subterraneas (pit houses), were distributed according to relief and geography under the domain of Araucaria forest. A strong expansion of Araucaria angustifolia in the late Holocene is recorded by various palynological studies as occurring after 1,500 years BP in Parana, 1,000 years BP in Santa Catarina and 1,140 years BP in Rio Grande do Sul over areas near archaeological settlements. These data deserve some attention. Furthermore, botanical sources indicate that Araucaria angustifolia need a dispersing factor, including birds, animals and humans. In spite of climate conditions being considered one of the major causes of increase, the possibility of contribution by pottery-producing hunter-gatherers of the Taquara/Itarare Tradition in seed dispersal by harvesting of seeds, and possible management and planting of this species.

abstract = {An underlying premise of ecological restoration is that it focuses on the recovery of degraded systems. While this is an apparently straightforward aim, there is in fact considerable variation in how the term “degraded” is defined, used and assessed. In addition, there is a notable subjective component to decisions regarding what is degraded and what isn't, and this often relates to the values and goals being considered. There is likely to be little argument over highly degraded systems where damage and loss of valued characteristics are evident. But where system change is less stark and the changes have mixed benefits and disbenefits, the decision on whether the system is degraded and hence in need of restoration becomes more difficult. As systems continue to change in the face of ongoing climate, land use and other environmental changes, decisions become more difficult regarding which systems are degraded and which are merely different from what was there before. Difference does not necessarily equate to degradation. Effective use of scarce management resources relies on an improved ability to openly debate and resolve such issues.},

abstract = {Global evidence posits that we are on the cusp of fire-driven 'tipping points' in some of the world's most important woody biomes including savannah woodlands, temperate forests, and boreal forests, with consequences of major changes in species dominance and vegetation type. The evidence also suggests that mega-fires are positive feedbacks to changing climates via carbon emissions, and will be responsible for large swings in water yield and quality from temperate forests at the regional scale.Two factors widely considered to have contributed to our current proximity to tipping points are changing climates and human management - the latter most obviously taking the form of allowing fuels to build up, either through policies of fire suppression or failure to implement sufficient fuel reduction fires - to the point where wildfire intensity increases dramatically. Much of the evidence comes from Australia and the USA, but domains such as Africa and the boreal north provide additional insights.Forests adapted to regimes of low-moderate intensity fires may not face the same challenges as the iconic ash forests of Australia and the coniferous forests of Yellowstone or the west coast of the USA that are adapted to high intensity fire. However the often modest physical barriers (including distance, topography and climate) between forests adapted to more frequent, low-moderate intensity fires on the one hand, and less frequent, high intensity fires on the other, are easily overcome by confluences of continually increasing fuel loads and changing climates that serve to increase both fire frequency and intensity.For temperate forests, we can mitigate the extent of large-scale, high intensity fires and their consequences if we carefully use fuel reduction fires and other standard forest management practises such as thinning. Mitigation will require assessing impacts on biodiversity of smaller, low-intensity fires at intervals of 5-10. years (to reduce fuels and mitigate fire size and intensity), against those of large-scale, high intensity wildfires at increasing (but unknown) frequency. Mitigation will require that forests be managed contiguously, not via different agencies with different objectives according to land tenure. Managing requires that governments and the communities they serve acknowledge the limitations of fire-suppression. Mitigating the incidence and effects of large-scale, high intensity fires through embracing the use of managed fire in conjunction with judicious use of fire suppression offers opportunity to avoid potentially large changes in vegetation and biomass (e.g. abundance of dominant species, biodiversity, fuel structure and loads), as well as in water yield and quality and carbon carrying capacity. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {* To conserve future biodiversity, a better understanding of the likely effects of climate and land-use change on the geographical distributions of species and the persistence of ecological communities is needed. Recent advances have integrated population dynamic processes into species distribution models (SDMs), to reduce potential biases in predictions and to better reflect the demographic nuances of incremental range shifts. However, there is no clear framework for selecting the most appropriate demographic-based model for a given data set or scientific question. * We review the computer-based modelling platforms currently used for the development of either population- or individual-based species range dynamics models. We describe the features and requirements of 20 software platforms commonly used to generate simulations of species ranges and abundances. We classify the platforms according to particular capabilities or features that account for user requirements and constraints, such as (i) ability to simulate simple to complex population dynamics, (ii) organism specificity or (iii) their computational capacities. * Using this classification, we develop a protocol for choosing the most appropriate framework for modelling species range dynamics based in data availability and research requirements. We find that the main differences between modelling platforms are related to the way in which they simulate population dynamics, the type of organisms they are able to model and the ecological processes they incorporate. We show that some platforms can be used as generic modelling software to investigate a broad range of ecological questions related to the range dynamics of most species, and how these are likely to change in the future in response to forecast climate and land-use change. We argue that model predictions will be improved by reducing usage to a smaller number of highly flexible freeware platforms. * Our approach provides ecologists and conservation biologists with a clear method for selecting the most appropriate software platform that meets their needs when developing SDMs coupled with population-dynamic processes. We argue that informed tool choice will translate to better predictions of species responses to climate and land-use change and improved conservation management.},

abstract = {One of the key problems in ecology is our need to anticipate the set of locations in which a species will be found (hereafter species' distributions). A major source of uncertainty in these models is the role of interactions among species (hereafter biotic interactions). Unfortunately, it is difficult to directly study this problem at large spatial scales and we lack a clear understanding of when biotic interactions shape species' distributions. We show a simple, direct link between the ease of species' coexistence and the importance of competition for shaping species' distributions. We show that increasing the ease of species' coexistence reduces the influence of biotic interactions. Changing the spatial scale of the analysis can reduce the influence of species interactions, but only when it promotes regional coexistence. Using these ideas, we analyze the conditions under which biotic interactions alter species' distributions in a Lotka–Volterra model of competition along an environmental gradient and argue that coexistence theory, rather than scale alone, provides a guide to the influence of species interactions. Our results provide a guide to the facets of biotic interactions that are necessary to anticipate their effects on species distributions. As such, we expect our work will help the development of more realistic distribution models.},

abstract = {1. Little is known about the pollinators of rare plants, which is cause for concern given that pollination is essential for the long-term survival of most plant species. The aim of this study was to determine the probable pollinators of three species of rare arable weed: red hemp-nettle Galeopsis angustifolia, small-flowered catchfly Silene gallica and spreading hedge-parsley Torilis arvensis. Species of arable weed are among those suffering the greatest declines in the UK. 2. Five field sites were chosen, two of which were sampled in 2 years. Visitation and pollen transport webs were constructed for the entire plant-pollinator community at each site. Visitation webs described the frequency with which each insect species visited each plant species. Pollen transport webs quantified which insect species transported the pollen of which plant species. 3. A wide range of insect species visited the three plant species. A pollinator importance index was calculated that combined information on both the relative abundance of each insect carrying the pollen of the rare plant and its pollen fidelity. Using this method Galeopsis angustifolia was most likely to be pollinated by Bombus pascuorum at one site and Sphaerophoria scripta at another. Silene gallica was also likely be pollinated by Sphaerophoria scripta. 4. The pollinator fauna of the three plant species varied considerably across their geographical range, but less from one year to the next. 5. Synthesis and applications. All three species of rare plant were linked to other plant species in the community by shared pollinators. In many cases these other plant species constituted the primary food sources for the shared pollinators. Therefore, the long-term survival of rare plant populations is likely to depend on the more common plant species in the community. We recommend that management of the rare plants studied here should also include the protection and management of populations of some of the more common plant species in their respective communities.},

abstract = {There is a growing interest in using trait-based approaches to characterize the functional structure of animal communities. Quantitative methods have been derived mostly for plant ecology, but it is now common to characterize the functional composition of various systems such as soils, coral reefs, pelagic food webs or terrestrial vertebrate communities. With the ever-increasing availability of distribution and trait data, a quantitative method to represent the different roles of animals in a community promise to find generalities that will facilitate cross-system comparisons. There is, however, currently no theory relating the functional composition of food webs to their dynamics and properties. The intuitive interpretation that more functional diversity leads to higher resource exploitation and better ecosystem functioning was brought from plant ecology and does not apply readily to food webs. Here we appraise whether there are interpretable metrics to describe the functional composition of food webs that could foster a better understanding of their structure and functioning. We first distinguish the various roles that traits have on food web topology, resource extraction (bottom-up effects), trophic regulation (top-down effects), and the ability to keep energy and materials within the community. We then discuss positive effects of functional trait diversity on food webs, such as niche construction and bottom-up effects. We follow with a discussion on the negative effects of functional diversity, such as enhanced competition (both exploitation and apparent) and top-down control. Our review reveals that most of our current understanding of the impact of functional trait diversity on food web properties and functioning comes from an over-simplistic representation of network structure with well-defined levels. We, therefore, conclude with propositions for new research avenues for both theoreticians and empiricists.},

METHODS AND RESULTS: From a set of microsatellite markers, a monomorphic microsatellite locus developed for the palm species Butia eriospatha was used to elucidate whether there are polymorphic sites in its flanking regions. DNA sequences ≈133 bp long were obtained. Aligned sequences show variation at 17 polymorphic sites with both insertions and nucleotide substitutions. Fourteen distinct sequences (alleles) among 22 individuals were identified. The percent sequence difference varied from 0.0 to 5{\%}, indicating that there is significant variation among sequences.

CONCLUSIONS: Due to significant levels of information and sequence diversity on a simple sequence repeat (SSR) locus of identical size, our study highlights that this molecular marker class can be a useful tool for population genetics and evolutionary studies for many plant species.},

Substrate distribution varied with canopy openness, and substrate favourability was a function of both canopy openness and seedling species. Lack of suitable substrates was the predominant factor limiting seedling density under full canopies. Partial canopy and gap sites provided a broad range of favourable substrates in close proximity to parent trees, resulting in the highest observed seedling densities. There was much higher effective dispersion of seedlings away from parent trees in gaps than in the partially cut stands. Seedling dispersion to clearcut sites was poor with seedlings being tightly restricted to a narrow band along the forest edge. Thus, seedling recruitment in these forests was a reflection of the interaction between the abundance of seed and substrate favourability, and the relative importance of these factors varied significantly with canopy structure.},

abstract = {Ecologists have long been puzzled by the fact that there are so many similar species in nature. Here we show that self-organized clusters of look-a-likes may emerge spontaneously from coevolution of competitors. The explanation is that there are two alternative ways to survive together: being sufficiently different or being sufficiently similar. Using a model based on classical competition theory, we demonstrate a tendency for evolutionary emergence of regularly spaced lumps of similar species along a niche axis. Indeed, such lumpy patterns are commonly observed in size distributions of organisms ranging from algae, zooplankton, and beetles to birds and mammals, and could not be well explained by earlier theory. Our results suggest that these patterns may represent self-constructed niches emerging from competitive interactions. A corollary of our findings is that, whereas in species-poor communities sympatric speciation and invasion of open niches is possible, species-saturated communities may be characterized by convergent evolution and invasion by look-a-likes.},

abstract = {Life-history theory posits that trade-offs between demographic rates constrain the range of viable life-history strategies. For coexisting tropical tree species, the best established demographic trade-off is the growth-survival trade-off. However, we know surprisingly little about co-variation of growth and survival with measures of reproduction. We analysed demographic rates from seed to adult of 282 co-occurring tropical tree and shrub species, including measures of reproduction and accounting for ontogeny. Besides the well-established fast–slow continuum, we identified a second major dimension of demographic variation: a trade-off between recruitment and seedling performance vs. growth and survival of larger individuals (≥ 1 cm dbh) corresponding to a ‘stature–recruitment' axis. The two demographic dimensions were almost perfectly aligned with two independent trait dimensions (shade tolerance and size). Our results complement recent analyses of plant life-history variation at the global scale and reveal that demographic trade-offs along multiple axes act to structure local communities.},

abstract = {It is commonly thought that temporal fluctuations in demographic parameters should be selected against because of the deleterious impacts variation can have on fitness. A critical underpinning of this prediction is the assumption that changes in environmental conditions map linearly into changes in demographic parameters over time. We detail why this assumption may often break down and why selection should not always favor buffering of demographic parameters against environmental stochasticity. To the contrary, nonlinear relationships between the environment and demographic performance can produce asymmetric temporal variation in demographic parameters that actually enhances fitness. We extend this result to structured populations using simulation and show that 'demographic lability' rather than 'buffering' may be adaptive, particularly in organisms with low juvenile or adult survival. Finally, we review previous ecological work, and indicate cases where 'demographic lability' may be adaptive, then conclude by identifying research that is needed to develop a theory of life-history evolution that encompasses both demographic buffering and lability.},

abstract = {Abstract Competition among trees is an important driver of community structure and dynamics in tropical forests. Neighboring trees may impact an individual tree?s growth rate and probability of mortality, but large-scale geographic and environmental variation in these competitive effects has yet to be evaluated across the tropical forest biome. We quantified effects of competition on tree-level basal area growth and mortality for trees ≥ 10 cm diameter across 151 {\~{}}1-ha plots in mature tropical forests in Amazonia and tropical Africa by developing non-linear models that accounted for wood density, tree size and neighborhood crowding. Using these models, we assessed how water availability (i.e., climatic water deficit) and soil fertility influenced the predicted plot-level strength of competition (i.e., the extent to which growth is reduced, or mortality is increased, by competition across all individual trees). On both continents, tree basal area growth decreased with wood density, and increased with tree size. Growth decreased with neighborhood crowding, which suggests that competition is important. Tree mortality decreased with wood density and generally increased with tree size, but was apparently unaffected by neighborhood crowding. Across plots, variation in the plot-level strength of competition was most strongly related to plot basal area (i.e., the sum of the basal area of all trees in a plot), with greater reductions in growth occurring in forests with high basal area, but in Amazonia the strength of competition also varied with plot-level wood density. In Amazonia, the strength of competition increased with water availability because of the greater basal area of wetter forests, but was only weakly related to soil fertility. In Africa, competition was weakly related to soil fertility, and invariant across the shorter water availability gradient. Overall, our results suggest that competition influences the structure and dynamics of tropical forests primarily through effects on individual tree growth rather than mortality, and that the strength of competition largely depends on environment-mediated variation in basal area.},

abstract = {Dispersal and density dependence are major determinants of spatial structure, population dynamics and coexistence for tropical forest plants. However, because these two processes can jointly influence spatial structure at similar scales, analysing spatial patterns to separate and quantify them is often difficult. Species functional traits can be useful indicators of dispersal and density dependence. However, few methods exist for linking functional traits to quantitative estimates of these processes that can be compared across multiple species. We analysed static spatial patterns of woody plant populations in the 50 ha Forest Dynamics Plot on Barro Colorado Island, Panama with methods that distinguished scale-specific differences in species aggregation. We then tested how these differences related to seven functional traits: growth form, dispersal syndrome, tree canopy layer, adult stature, seed mass, wood density and shade tolerance. Next, we fit analytically tractable spatial moment models to the observed spatial structure of species characterized by similar trait values, which allowed us to estimate relationships of functional traits with the spatial scale of dispersal, and the spatial scale and intensity of negative density dependence. Our results confirm that lianas are more aggregated than trees, and exhibit increased aggregation within canopy gaps. For trees, increased seed mass, wood density and shade tolerance were associated with less intense negative density dependence, while higher canopy layers and increased stature were associated with decreased aggregation and better dispersal. Spatial structure for trees was also strongly determined by dispersal syndrome. Averaged across all spatial scales, zoochory was more effective than wind dispersal, which was more effective than explosive dispersal. However, at intermediate scales, zoochory was associated with more aggregation than wind dispersal, potentially because of differences in short-distance dispersal and the intensity of negative density dependence. Synthesis. We develop new tools for identifying significant associations between functional traits and spatial structure, and for linking these associations to quantitative estimates of dispersal scale and the strength and scale of density dependence. Our results help clarify how these processes influence woody plant species on Barro Colorado, and demonstrate how these tools can be applied to other sites and systems.},

abstract = {Invasive fish species disrupt ecosystems and cause economic damage. Several methods have been discussed to control populations of invasive fish including the release of YY-males. YY-males are fish that have 2 male chromosomes compared to a XY-male. When YY-males mate, they only produce male (XY) offspring. This decreases the female proportion of the population and can, in theory, eradicate local populations by biasing the sex-ratio. YY-males have been used as a population control tool for brook trout in montane streams and lakes in Idaho, USA. The YY-male control method has been discussed for grass carp in Lake Erie, North America. We developed and presented an integral projection model for grass carp to model the use of YY-males as a control method for populations in this lake. Using only the YY-male control method, we found that high levels of YY-males would need to be release annually to control the species. Specifically, these levels were the same order of magnitude as the baseline adult population (e.g., 1000 YY-males needed to be released annual for 20 years to control a baseline adult population of 2500 grass carp). These levels may not be reasonable or obtainable for fisheries managers given the impacts of YY-males on aquatic vegetation and other constraints of natural resource management.},

abstract = {Current climatic changes have increased the need to forecast population responses to climate variability. A common approach to address this question is through models that project current population state using the functional relationship between demographic rates and climatic variables. We argue that this approach can lead to erroneous conclusions when interpopulation dispersal is not considered. We found that immigration can release the population from climate-driven trajectories even when local vital rates are climate dependent. We illustrated this using individual-based data on a trans-equatorial migratory seabird, the Scopoli's shearwater Calonectris diomedea, in which the variation of vital rates has been associated with large-scale climatic indices. We compared the population annual growth rate $\lambda$i, estimated using local climate-driven parameters with $\rho$i, a population growth rate directly estimated from individual information and that accounts for immigration. While $\lambda$i varied as a function of climatic variables, reflecting the climate-dependent parameters, $\rho$i did not, indicating that dispersal decouples the relationship between population growth and climate variables from that between climatic variables and vital rates. Our results suggest caution when assessing demographic effects of climatic variability especially in open populations for very mobile organisms such as fish, marine mammals, bats, or birds. When a population model cannot be validated or it is not detailed enough, ignoring immigration might lead to misleading climate-driven projections.},

The components of a general theory of ecology have existed for the past half century; ecologists simply have failed to explicitly recognize them.We present a general theory of ecology and show how it relates to ecologys numerous constituent theories and models. The general theory consists of a description of the domain of ecology and a set of fundamental principles. The domain of ecology is the spatial and temporal patterns of the distribution and abundance of organisms, including causes and consequences. Fundamental principles are broad statements about the patterns that exist and the processes that operate within a domain. The seven fundamental principles of the theory of ecology are: the heterogeneous distribution of organisms, interactions of organisms, contingency, envi- ronmental heterogeneity, finite and heterogeneous resources, the mortality of organisms, and the evolutionary cause of ecological properties. These principles are the necessary and sufficient elements for a general theory of ecology. The propositions of any constituent theory of ecology can be shown to be a consequence of these fundamental principles along with principles from other science domains. The general theory establishes relationships among constituent theories through shared fundamental principles. The next challenge is to develop and integrate unified, constituent theories and to establish the relationships among them within the framework established by the general theory.},

abstract = {1. There is growing concern about declining species diversity in agro-ecosystems caused by agricultural intensification at the field and landscape scales. Species diversity of arable weeds is classically related to local abiotic factors and resource conditions. It is believed to be enhanced by organic farming but the surrounding landscape may also be important. 2. This study assessed the ruderal vegetation, seed bank and seed rain in 24 winter wheat fields to examine the relative importance of organic vs. conventional farming and landscape complexity for weed species diversity. Diversity was partitioned into its additive components: alpha, beta and gamma diversity. Percentage arable land in a circular landscape sector of 1-km radius around each study site was used as an indicator of landscape complexity. 3. Weed species diversity in the vegetation, seed rain and seed bank was higher in organic than in conventional fields. Increasing landscape complexity enhanced species diversity more strongly in the vegetation of conventional than organic fields, to the extent that diversity was similar in both farming systems when the landscape was complex. Species diversity of the seed bank was increased by landscape complexity irrespective of farming system. 4. Overall diversity was largely determined by the high heterogeneity between and within the fields (beta diversity). Only in very few cases could higher weed species diversity in complex landscapes and/or organic farming be related to species dependence on landscape or farming system. 5. Synthesis and applications. Local weed species diversity was influenced by both landscape complexity and farming system. Species diversity under organic farming systems was clearly higher in simple landscapes. Conventional vegetation reached similar diversity levels when the surrounding landscape was complex through the presence of refugia for weed populations. Consequently, agri-environment schemes designed to preserve and enhance biodiversity should not only consider the management of single fields but also of the surrounding landscape.},

Both temporal and spatial processes determine biodiversity responses to changes in landscape structure, and it is therefore necessary that all aspects of connectivity are considered together. In this perspective, we use a case study to outline why we believe that both the spatial and temporal components of functional connectivity are important for understanding biodiversity patterns in the present-day landscape, and how they can also help us to make better-informed decisions about conserving and restoring landscapes and improving resilience to future change.},

abstract = {1 In forest communities, species coexistence can be favoured by disturbance-related variations in light regime coupled with rank reversal in species performance. The objective of this study was to determine if a major canopy disturbance, resulting from an ice storm, would favour the coexistence of sugar maple (Acer saccharum) and beech (Fagus grandifolia) in an old-growth forest located near the northern limit of the species' range. 2 The growth, density and frequency of occurrence of understorey stems were evaluated 7 years after the ice storm and compared with pre-disturbance values to determine if sugar maple, a slightly less shade-tolerant species, would be favoured over beech. 3 Although height and radial growth increased three- to five-fold, and {\textgreater}70{\%} of the 5-10 cm d.b.h. stems showed a release, sugar maple did not benefit more from the opening of the canopy than beech. 4 The inability of sugar maple to outgrow beech might be related to the high proportion of beech root sprouts at our site, suggesting that the potential for the disturbance-mediated mechanism to slow the competitive exclusion of maple might decrease as the importance of vegetative reproduction increases in beech. 5 Prior to the disturbance, sugar maple was more abundant and occurred in a larger proportion of the plots among small size classes, while beech dominated in the larger size classes. Although some increases in the density of both species were detected after the disturbance, the general trends of relative abundance and distribution of the species were not modified significantly. 6 Our results do not indicate that a single canopy disturbance such as the major 1998 ice storm significantly favoured sugar maple over beech. When a disturbance opens the canopy, competition for light in gaps may tend to maintain or reinforce a pre-existing hierarchy instead of reversing it, especially when interspecific differences in post-disturbance growth are small or absent, as in this study. 7 This study shows that the dynamics of sugar maple - beech communities are more complex than previously envisaged and that revised models should incorporate additional factors (e.g. vegetative reproduction) that might also play an important role in regulating community dynamics.},

abstract = {In the vicinity of tipping points--or more precisely bifurcation points--ecosystems recover slowly from small perturbations. Such slowness may be interpreted as a sign of low resilience in the sense that the ecosystem could easily be tipped through a critical transition into a contrasting state. Indicators of this phenomenon of critical slowing down (CSD)' include a rise in temporal correlation and variance. Such indicators of CSD can provide an early warning signal of a nearby tipping point. Or, they may offer a possibility to rank reefs, lakes or other ecosystems according to their resilience. The fact that CSD may happen across a wide range of complex ecosystems close to tipping points implies a powerful generality. However, indicators of CSD are not manifested in all cases where regime shifts occur. This is because not all regime shifts are associated with tipping points. Here, we review the exploding literature about this issue to provide guidance on what to expect and what not to expect when it comes to the CSD-based early warning signals for critical transitions.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

It helps understand the species-area relationship, a fundamental pattern in ecology and an essential tool for conservation. The classic TIB does not, however, account for the complex structure of ecological systems. We extend the TIB to take into account trophic interactions and derive a species-specific model for occurrence probability. We find that the properties of the regional food web influence the species-area relationship, and that, in return, immigration and extinction dynamics affect local food web properties. We compare the accuracy of the classic TIB to our trophic TIB to predict community composition of real food webs and find strong support for our trophic extension of the TIB. Our approach provides a parsimonious explanation to species distributions and open new perspectives to integrate the complexity of ecological interactions into simple species distribution models.},

abstract = {Species' distributions will respond to climate change based on the relationship between local demographic processes and climate and how this relationship varies based on range position. A rarely tested demographic prediction is that populations at the extremes of a species' climate envelope (e.g., populations in areas with the highest mean annual temperature) will be most sensitive to local shifts in climate (i.e., warming). We tested this prediction using a dynamic species distribution model linking demographic rates to variation in temperature and precipitation for wood frogs (Lithobates sylvaticus) in North America. Using long-term monitoring data from 746 populations in 27 study areas, we determined how climatic variation affected population growth rates and how these relationships varied with respect to long-term climate. Some models supported the predicted pattern, with negative effects of extreme summer temperatures in hotter areas and positive effects on recruitment for summer water availability in drier areas. We also found evidence of interacting temperature and precipitation influencing population size, such as extreme heat having less of a negative effect in wetter areas. Other results were contrary to predictions, such as positive effects of summer water availability in wetter parts of the range and positive responses to winter warming especially in milder areas. In general, we found wood frogs were more sensitive to changes in temperature or temperature interacting with precipitation than to changes in precipitation alone. Our results suggest that sensitivity to changes in climate cannot be predicted simply by knowing locations within the species' climate envelope. Many climate processes did not affect population growth rates in the predicted direction based on range position. Processes such as species-interactions, local adaptation, and interactions with the physical landscape likely affect the responses we observed. Our work highlights the need to measure demographic responses to changing climate.},

Here we describe an experiment that takes advantage of the rapid evolutionary response of bacteria to disentangle the role of phylogenetic and species diversity. We impose a strong selection regime on marine bacterial lineages and assemble the ancestral and evolved lines in microcosms of varying lineage and phylogenetic diversity. We find that the relationship between phylogenetic diversity and productivity is strong for the ancestral lineages but brakes down for the evolved lineages. Our results not only emphasize the potential of using phylogeny to evaluate ecosystem functioning, but also they warn against using phylogenetics as a proxy for functional diversity without good information on species evolutionary history.},

abstract = {Natural regeneration is crucial for silvicultural approaches based on the continuous presence of a forest cover, or Continuous Cover Forestry (CCF). Light is considered one of the most important factors affecting regeneration growth under canopy cover. Sitka spruce, western hemlock and Douglas fir are important forestry species both in Europe and in North America with potential to be used together under CCF management. Our aim was to develop predictive early-growth models for these species growing beneath forest canopies, and to investigate species differences in terms of shade tolerance. We sampled regenerating trees growing under canopy cover at multiple sites in the UK. We compared alternative asymptotic non-linear models as a function of light availability to simulate the height growth for all species and the diameter growth for Sitka spruce and western hemlock only. We included tree size and intra-regeneration competition as predictors, which affected the asymptotic growth at full light and/or the growth rate at which such asymptote was reached. We also calibrated models of apical dominance ratio (ADR, for all species) and live crown ratio (LCR, for Douglas fir and Sitka spruce only) as a function of light availability, tree size and intra-regeneration competition. Species-specific non-linear models best simulated the light-growth responses (3-points Logistic for Sitka spruce, Michaelis-Menten for western hemlock, asymptotic with offset for Douglas fir). Tree size in all cases increased the asymptotic growth and in two cases also the growth rate. Competition significantly reduced the growth for Sitka spruce and western hemlock, with the diameter growth reduced more than height growth. Both the ADR and the LCR increased with light availability, with species-specific differences for LCR but not for ADR. For Sitka spruce an apical dominance ratio of 1.5 can be used in the field to identify adequate growing conditions. An increasing shade tolerance ranking was found as Douglas fir ≤ Sitka spruce {\textless} western hemlock. We conclude that modelling light-growth requires species-specific non-linear functions and that predictions are improved by including size and competition. The developed predictive models for height and diameter growth will allow accurate modelling of the study species in CCF management.},

abstract = {The importance of foliar absorption of water and atmospheric solutes in conifers was recognised in the 1970s, and the importance of fog as a water source in forest environments has been recently demonstrated. Araucaria angustifolia (Araucariaceae) is an emergent tree species that grows in montane forests of southern Brazil, where rainfall and fog are frequent events, leading to frequent wetting of the leaves. Despite anatomical evidence in favour of leaf water absorption, there is no information on the existence and physiological significance of a such process. In this study, we test the hypothesis that the use of atmospheric water by leaves takes place and is physiologically relevant for the species, by comparing growth, water relations and nutritional status between plants grown under two conditions of soil water (well-watered and water-stressed plants) and three types of leaf spraying (none, water and nutrient solution spray). Leaf spraying had a greater effect in improving plant water relations when plants were under water stress. Plant growth was more responsive to water available to the leaves than to the roots, and was equally increased by both types of leaf spraying, with no interaction with soil water status. Spraying leaves with nutrient solution increased shoot ramification and raised the concentrations of N, P, K, Zn, Cu and Fe in the roots. Our results provide strong indications that water and nutrients are indeed absorbed by leaves of A. angustifolia, and that this process might be as important as water uptake by its roots.},

abstract = {Aim  The study and prediction of species–environment relationships is currently mainly based on species distribution models. These purely correlative models neglect spatial population dynamics and assume that species distributions are in equilibrium with their environment. This causes biased estimates of species niches and handicaps forecasts of range dynamics under environmental change. Here we aim to develop an approach that statistically estimates process-based models of range dynamics from data on species distributions and permits a more comprehensive quantification of forecast uncertainties. Innovation  We present an approach for the statistical estimation of process-based dynamic range models (DRMs) that integrate Hutchinson's niche concept with spatial population dynamics. In a hierarchical Bayesian framework the environmental response of demographic rates, local population dynamics and dispersal are estimated conditional upon each other while accounting for various sources of uncertainty. The method thus: (1) jointly infers species niches and spatiotemporal population dynamics from occurrence and abundance data, and (2) provides fully probabilistic forecasts of future range dynamics under environmental change. In a simulation study, we investigate the performance of DRMs for a variety of scenarios that differ in both ecological dynamics and the data used for model estimation. Main conclusions  Our results demonstrate the importance of considering dynamic aspects in the collection and analysis of biodiversity data. In combination with informative data, the presented framework has the potential to markedly improve the quantification of ecological niches, the process-based understanding of range dynamics and the forecasting of species responses to environmental change. It thereby strengthens links between biogeography, population biology and theoretical and applied ecology.},

We used these data to construct individual- based models that examine the effects of CDD on population growth rates ({\"{e}}) across life-history stages. Recruitment was driven by positive CDD for all species, supporting the predator satiation hypothesis, while negative CDD affected seedling and sapling growth of two species, significantly reducing {\"{e}}. This negative CDD on juvenile growth overshadowed the positive CDD of recruitment, suggesting the cumulative effects of CDD during seedling and sapling development has greater importance than the positive CDD during infrequent masting events. Overall, CDD varied among positive, neutral and negative effects across life-history stages for all species, suggesting that assessments of CDD on transitions between just two stages (e.g. seeds seedlings or juveniles mature trees) probably misrepresent the importance of CDD on population growth and stability.},

abstract = {The endemic New Caledonian conifer Agathis ovata occurs as an emergent tree in fire-prone shrublands (maquis), and fire-sensitive rainforest. Growth, survivorship and recruit- ment over 5 yr were compared for populations from forest and maquis on ultramafic substrates in New Caledonia to investi- gate whether demographic behaviour varied in response to the strongly contrasting forest and shrubland environments. Growth of seedlings and of small (30-100 cm height) and large (100 cm height; 5 cm DBH) saplings was slow, but varied significantly among stages, site types and years. The greatest difference in growth rates was among stages, seed- lings growing 0.34 cm.yr–1, small saplings 1.06 cm.yr–1 and large saplings 2.13 cm.yr–1. Tree DBH increased by only 0.05 cm.yr–1 and, based on these rates, individuals with DBH of 30 cm are estimated to be more than 700 yr old. Few trees (3.5{\%}) produced cones in any year and seedling recruitment was low, but some recruitment was recorded each year in both maquis and forest. Rates of recruitment per parent were highest in forest (1.28.yr–1, cf 0.78.yr–1), but the higher density of trees in maquis meant that overall recruitment was greater there (92 ha–1.yr–1, cf 56 ha–1.yr–1). Seedling mortality ranged from 0.9 to 2.9{\%} among years with no significant difference between maquis and forest. No sapling mortality was recorded, but annual tree mortality ranged from 0 to 1.4{\%}. Evidence from a recently burned site indicated that while trees may survive fire, seedlings and saplings do not. Post-fire seedling recruit- ment per ha from surviving trees was four times lower than in unburned sites, but growth rates were four times higher. Similar demographic attributes, including high survivor- ship, low growth rate and low rates of recruitment over a long reproductive life, characterize Agathis ovata populations in both maquis and rainforest in New Caledonia and are indica- tive of a broad tolerance of light environments that is unusual among tree species. These demographic attributes help to explain the long-term persistence of the species in these strongly contrasting habitats.},

The establishment of protected areas has been one of the conservation strategies adopted for this biome. Although there are several studies developed on mammals in conservation areas, the sampling methods used in these studies differ in several aspects. This study aimed to compare sampling methodologies of medium and large-sized mammals, test the efficiency of different baits in attracting these mammals in sand plots and test the relationship of the most sampled species with baits used in a peri-urban Conservation Unit in Brazilian Savanna, in Campo Grande, Mato Grosso do Sul State. The registry of medium and large-sized mammals was done through active search, sand plots and camera traps. Eighteen species of medium and large-sized mammals were recorded, two of which are endangered. Among the different methods used, sand-plots were the most efficient. The most sampled species were not related to any specific bait.

Abstract Distance and discrete geographic barriers play a role in isolating populations, as seed and pollen dispersal become limited. Nearby populations without any geo-graphic barrier between them may also suffer from ecological isolation driven by habitat heterogeneity, which may promote divergence by local adaptation and drift. Likewise, elevation gradients may influence the genetic structure and diversity of populations, particularly those marginally distributed. Bathysa aus-tralis (Rubiaceae) is a widespread tree along the elevation gradient of the Serra do Mar, SE Brazil. This self-compatible species is pollinated by bees and wasps and has autochoric seeds, suggesting restricted gene dispersal. We investigated the distribution of genetic diversity in six B. australis populations at two extreme sites along an elevation gradient: a lowland site (80–216 m) and an upland site (1010–1100 m.a.s.l.). Nine microsatellite loci were used to test for genetic structure and to verify differences in genetic diversity between sites. We found a marked genetic structure on a scale as small as 6 km (F ST = 0.21), and two distinct clusters were identified, each corresponding to a site. Although B. australis is continuously distributed along the elevation gradient, we have not observed a gene flow between the extreme populations. This might be related to B. australis biological features and creates a potential scenario for adaptation to the different conditions imposed by the elevation gradient. We failed to find an isolation-by-distance pattern; although on the fine scale, all populations showed spatial autocorrelation until {\~{}}10-20 m. Elevation difference was a relevant factor though, but we need further sampling effort to check its correlation with genetic distance. The lowland populations had a higher allelic richness and showed higher rare allele counts than the upland ones. The upland site may be more selective, eliminating rare alleles, as we did not find any evi-dence for bottleneck.},

We perturbed an empirical sagebrush steppe community model to remove the demographic effect of niche differences and quantify their impact on coexistence. With stabilizing mechanisms operating, all species showed positive growth rates when rare, generating stable coexistence. Fluctuation-independent mechanisms contributed more than temporal variability to coexistence and operated more strongly on recruitment than growth or survival. As expected, removal of stabilizing niche differences led to extinction of all inferior competitors. However, complete exclusion required 300– 400 years, indicating small fitness differences among species. Our results show an {\^{O}}excess{\~{O}} of niche differences: stabilizing mechanisms were not only strong enough to maintain diversity but were much stronger than necessary given the small fitness differences.

abstract = {A rich body of knowledge links biodiversity to ecosystem functioning (BEF), but it is primarily focused on small scales. We review the current theory and identify six expectations for scale dependence in the BEF relationship: (1) a nonlinear change in the slope of the BEF relationship with spatial scale; (2) a scale-dependent relationship between ecosystem stability and spatial extent; (3) coexistence within and among sites will result in a positive BEF relationship at larger scales; (4) temporal autocorrelation in environmental variability affects species turnover and thus the change in BEF slope with scale; (5) connectivity in metacommunities generates nonlinear BEF and stability relationships by affecting population synchrony at local and regional scales; (6) spatial scaling in food web structure and diversity will generate scale dependence in ecosystem functioning. We suggest directions for synthesis that combine approaches in metaecosystem and metacommunity ecology and integrate cross-scale feedbacks. Tests of this theory may combine remote sensing with a generation of networked experiments that assess effects at multiple scales. We also show how anthropogenic land cover change may alter the scaling of the BEF relationship. New research on the role of scale in BEF will guide policy linking the goals of managing biodiversity and ecosystems.},

abstract = {The problem of scale has been a critical impediment to incorporating im- portant fine-scale processes into global ecosystem models. Our knowledge of fine-scale physiological and ecological processes comes from a variety of measurements, ranging from forest plot inventories to remote sensing, made at spatial resolutions considerably smaller than the large scale at which global ecosystem models are defined. In this paper, we describe a new individual-based, terrestrial biosphere model, which we label the eco- system demography model (ED).We then introduce a general method for scaling stochastic individual-based models of ecosystem dynamics (gap models) such as ED to large scales. The method accounts for the fine-scale spatial heterogeneity within an ecosystem caused by stochastic disturbance events, operating at scales down to individual canopy-tree-sized gaps. By conditioning appropriately on the occurrence of these events, we derive a size- and age-structured (SAS) approximation for the first moment of the stochastic ecosystem model. With this approximation, it is possible to make predictions about the large scales of interest from a description of the fine-scale physiological and population-dynamic pro- cesses without simulating the fate of every plant individually. We use the SAS approxi- mation to implement our individual-based biosphere model over South America from 15? Nto15? S, showing that the SAS equations are accurate across a range of environmental conditions and resulting ecosystem types.We then compare the predictions of the biosphere model to regional data and to intensive data at specific sites. Analysis of the model at these sites illustrates the importance of fine-scale heterogeneity in governing large-scale eco- system function, showing how population and community-level processes influence eco- system composition and structure, patterns of aboveground carbon accumulation, and net ecosystem production.},

The Canadian boreal forests, which occupy about 30{\%} of the boreal forests worldwide and 77{\%} of Canada's total forested land, play a critical role in the albedo of Earth's surface and in its global carbon budget. Many of the previously reported regional-scale impacts of drought on tree mortality have affected low- and middle-latitude tropical regions and the temperate forests of the western United States, but no study has examined high-latitude boreal regions with multiple species at a regional scale using long-term forest permanent sampling plots. Here, we estimated tree mortality in natural stands throughout Canada's boreal forests using data from the permanent sampling plots and statistical models. We found that tree mortality rates increased by an overall average of 4.7{\%} yr−1 from 1963 to 2008, with higher mortality rate increases in western regions than in eastern regions (about 4.9 and 1.9{\%} yr−1, respectively). The water stress created by regional drought may be the dominant contributor to these widespread increases in tree mortality rates across tree species, sizes, elevations, longitudes and latitudes. Western Canada seems to have been more sensitive to drought than eastern Canada.},

In the forest fragment, 121 males, 99 females, 66 seedlings and 92 juveniles were mapped and genotyped, together with 210 seeds. In the tree group, nine male and two female adults were mapped and genotyped, together with 20 seeds. Paternity analysis within the forest fragment indicated that at least 4{\%} of the seeds, 3{\%} of the seedlings and 7{\%} of the juveniles were fertilized by pollen from trees in the adjacent group, and 6{\%} of the seeds were fertilized by pollen from trees outside these stands. The average pollination distance within the forest fragment was 83 m; when the tree group was included the pollination distance was 2006 m. The average number of effective pollen donors was estimated as 12.6. Mother-trees within the fragment could be assigned to all seedlings and juveniles, suggesting an absence of seed immigration. The distance of seedlings and juveniles from their assigned mother-trees ranged from 0.35 to 291 m (with an average of 83 m). Significant spatial genetic structure among adult trees, seedlings, and juveniles was detected up to 50 m, indicating seed dispersal over a short distance. The effective pollination neighborhood ranged from 0.4 to 3.3 ha. The results suggest that seed dispersal is restricted but that there is long-distance pollen dispersal between the forest fragment and the tree group; thus, the two stands of trees are not isolated.},

abstract = {Regeneration of trees in canopy gaps created by timber harvest is vital for the sustainability of many managed forests. In northern hardwood forests of the Great Lakes region of North America, regeneration density and composition are highly variable because of multiple drivers that include browsing by herbivores, seed availability, and physical characteristics of forest gaps and stands. The long-term consequences of variability in regeneration for economic productivity and wildlife habitat are uncertain. To better understand and evaluate drivers and long-term consequences of regeneration variability, simulation models that combine statistical models of regeneration with established forest growth and yield models are useful. We present the structure, parameterization, testing and use of a stochastic, regression-based compositional forest gap regeneration model developed with the express purpose of being integrated with the US Forest Service forest growth and yield model 'Forest Vegetation Simulator' (FVS) to form an integrated simulation model. The innovative structure of our regeneration model represents only those trees regenerating in gaps with the best chance of subsequently growing into the canopy (i.e., the tallest). Using a multi-model inference (MMI) approach and field data collected from the Upper Peninsula of Michigan we find that 'habitat type' (a proxy for soil moisture and nutrients), deer density, canopy openness and basal area of mature ironwood (Ostrya virginiana) in the vicinity of a gap drive regeneration abundance and composition. The best model from our MMI approach indicates that where deer densities are high, ironwood appears to gain a competitive advantage over sugar maple (Acer saccharum) and that habitat type is an important predictor of overall regeneration success. Using sensitivity analyses we show that this regeneration model is sufficiently robust for use with FVS to simulate forest dynamics over long time periods (i.e., 200 years).},

A large amount of useful theory pivots on the assumption of equilibrium dynamics. The preceding transient is, however, of genuine conservation concern as it encompasses the short-term impact of natural or anthropogenic disturbance on the population. We review recent theoretical advances in deterministic transient analysis of matrix projection models, considering how disturbance can alter population dynamics by provoking a new population trajectory. We illustrate these impacts using plant and vertebrate systems across contiguous and fragmented landscapes. Short-term responses are of fundamental relevance for applied ecology, because the time-scale of transient effects is often similar to the length of many conservation projects. Investigation of the immediate, post-disturbance phase is vital for understanding how population processes respond to widespread disturbance in the short- and into the long term. Synthesis and applications. Transient analysis is critical for understanding and predicting the consequences of management activities. By considering short-term population responses to perturbations, especially in long-lived species, managers can develop more informed strategies for species harvesting or controlling of invasive species. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Authors.

abstract = {Aim Current interest in forecasting changes to species ranges has resulted in a multitude of approaches to species distribution models (SDMs). However, most approaches include only a small subset of the available information, and many ignore smaller-scale processes such as growth, fecundity and dispersal. Further-more, different approaches often produce divergent predictions with no simple method to reconcile them. Here, we present a flexible framework for integrating models at multiple scales using hierarchical Bayesian methods. Location Eastern North America (as an example). Methods Our framework builds a metamodel that is constrained by the results of multiple sub-models and provides probabilistic estimates of species presence. We applied our approach to a simulated dataset to demonstrate the integration of a correlative SDM with a theoretical model. In a second example, we built an inte-grated model combining the results of a physiological model with presence– absence data for sugar maple (Acer saccharum), an abundant tree native to eastern North America. Results For both examples, the integrated models successfully included informa-tion from all data sources and substantially improved the characterization of uncer-tainty. For the second example, the integrated model outperformed the source models with respect to uncertainty when modelling the present range of the species. When projecting into the future, the model provided a consensus view of two models that differed substantially in their predictions. Uncertainty was reduced where the models agreed and was greater where they diverged, providing a more realistic view of the state of knowledge than either source model. Main conclusions We conclude by discussing the potential applications of our method and its accessibility to applied ecologists. In ideal cases, our framework can be easily implemented using off-the-shelf software. The framework has wide poten-tial for use in species distribution modelling and can drive better integration of multi-source and multi-scale data into ecological decision-making.},

abstract = {Given the substantial contributions of forest biodiversity and ecosystem services to society, forest sciences have a large potential to contribute to the integrity and sustainability of our future. This is especially true when the roles of biodiversity for sustaining ecosystem services are considered. The rapid expansion of sustainable forest management (SFM) has resulted in the adoption of various forest management frameworks intended to safeguard biodiversity. Concurrently, the importance of forest ecosystem services has been increasingly recognized. Although some initiatives aimed at conserving both biodiversity and ecosystem services are emerging, knowledge gaps still exist about their relationships and potential trade-offs in forests. Given recent advancements, increasing opportunities and some lags in forest ecology, further research on biodiversity, ecosystem functions and services will play substantial roles in the development of SFM practices. Here, we identified key issues including (i) relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem function as a foundation of ecological integrity, (ii) resilience thinking to better prepare for and adapt to environmental changes, (iii) social–ecological perspectives that facilitate real-world conservation and management and (iv) theory-driven restoration that bridges science and practice. Thus, we illustrate priorities and future possibilities in applied ecology studies in forests, which will help society and ecosystems to build capacity and resilience to face uncertainty in the changing environment. Synthesis and applications. Under substantial human influences, forests are highly likely to be largely altered, potentially leading to the emergence of novel ecosystems or alternative stable states. Management thus needs more flexible, novel measures to address the significant uncertainty this generates. Resilience-based approaches are important to respond adaptively to future changes and cope with surprises, potentially providing multiple options. Although challenges exist, theory should play an important role in managing, conserving and restoring forest ecosystems. The issues discussed here should receive further attention in the context of the multiple goals of sustainable forest management.},

abstract = {In metapopulation dynamics turnover of populations in isolated patches may be frequent. Regional survival of a species in such a system with frequent extinctions hinges on its colonization ability. Colonization is more than just dispersal; when a propagule reaches a new patch it faces higher extinction probabilities than does an established population. Extinction models as well as empirical data suggest that a large propagule with a potential for rapid increase in a varying environment, or with a low mortality rate in an environment perceived as constant, has a higher probability of successful colonization. Large variation in population size when it is still small increases the risk of failure. Factors introducing such variation are demographic stochasticity and environmental variation. It is hard to single out demographic traits that ensure good colonizing ability, since colonization can be achieved in many different ways, but generalists and species with self‐fertilization seem to be superior.

abstract = {Phenological shifts constitute one of the clearest manifestations of climate warming. Advanced emergence is widely reported in high-latitude ectotherms, but a significant number of species exhibit delayed, or no change in, emergence. Here we present a mechanistic theoretical framework that reconciles these disparate observations and predicts population-level phenological patterns based solely on data on temperature responses of the underly-ing life history traits. Our model, parameterized with data from insects at different latitudes, shows that peak abundance occurs earlier in the year when warming increases the mean environ-mental temperature, but is delayed when warming increases the amplitude of seasonal fluctuations. We find that warming does not necessarily lead to a longer activity period in high-latitude species because it elevates summer temperatures above the upper limit for reproduction and development. Our findings both con-firm and confound expectations for ectotherm species affected by climate warming: an increase in the mean temperature is more detrimental to low-latitude species adapted to high mean tem-peratures and low-amplitude seasonal fluctuations; an increase in seasonal fluctuations is more detrimental to high-latitude species adapted to low mean temperatures and high-amplitude fluctuations. phenological shifts | stage-structured population model | variable developmental delay | climate change | life history traits T emperature is the major abiotic factor that affects phenol-ogy, the seasonal timing of life history events. Climate warm-ing is increasingly disrupting natural phenological patterns, but the consequences of such disruptions on population dynamics and species interactions are poorly understood (1, 2). Given that ectotherms (microbes, plants, invertebrates, fish, amphib-ians, and reptiles) constitute the vast majority of biodiversity on the planet, elucidating the connection between their phe-nology and population dynamics is a crucial research priority (3–5). Ectotherm life history traits such as fecundity, develop-ment, and survivorship exhibit plastic responses to tempera-ture variation (6): when the temperature changes, the response changes accordingly (7, 8). These responses are the result of tem-perature effects on the underlying biochemical processes (e.g., reaction kinetics, enzyme inactivation, hormonal regulation) and take qualitative forms (monotonic, unimodal) that are conserved across ectotherm taxa (9–15). It is these trait responses that we must focus on if we are to predict how warming-induced pheno-logical changes influence ectotherm population dynamics. The nature of thermal adaptation dictates that trait responses be concave-up or concave-down functions of temperature (7, 16– 18). Based on Jensen's inequality (19), we know that a tem-perature response function that is concave up (e.g., exponen-tial) will yield a higher average response in a more variable environment while a function that is concave down (e.g., uni-modal) will yield a lower average response in a more variable environment. Per capita birth rate of all ectotherms exhibits a unimodal (i.e., concave-down) response to temperature. A concave-down response means that higher-latitude (e.g., tem-perate) species, which have wider response breadths (greater plasticity), will exhibit lower average performance than lower-latitude (e.g., tropical) species, a necessary cost of thermal adap-tation to higher-latitude environments. In this case stabilizing selection drives thermal optima of lower-latitude ectotherms to coincide with the mean temperature while that of higher-latitude ectotherms evolves to exceed the mean habitat temperature (20). This difference in thermal optima is well documented in the empirical literature (12, 15, 20, 21). These latitudinal differences in thermal adaptation suggest that warming should have differential effects on lower-latitude and higher-latitude species. Because tropical ectotherms' ther-mal optima coincide with the mean habitat temperature, an increase in the mean temperature will cause these optima to fall below the mean, with the result that the birth rate will be below its optimal value, and the mortality rate will be higher, for most of the year. If the mean temperature increases to a level at which the mortality rate exceeds the birth rate, the species will go extinct. In contrast, because temperate ectotherms' ther-mal optima exceed the mean habitat temperature, a moder-ate increase in the mean temperature is likely to be beneficial. Hence, warming involving an increase in the mean tempera-ture is likely to be more detrimental to tropical ectotherms than to temperate ectotherms. In contrast, warming involving an increase in seasonal temperature fluctuations [e.g., an increase in warm and cold extremes (22)] is likely to be more detrimen-tal to temperate ectotherms than to tropical ectotherms. This is because the concave-up nature of the mortality response dic-tates that the average mortality rate must be higher when sea-sonal fluctuations are larger. At the same time, the concave-down nature of the birth rate response means a lower average birth rate. If warming causes the magnitude of fluctuations to exceed the species' response breadths, the average mortality rate will exceed the average birth rate, predisposing the species to},

abstract = {A general model of competitive and apparent competitive interactions in a spatially-variable environment is developed and analyzed to extend findings on coexistence in a temporally-variable environment to the spatial case and to elucidate new principles. In particular, coexistence mechanisms are divided into variation-dependent and variation-independent mechanisms with variation-dependent mechanisms including spatial generalizations of relative nonlinearity and the storage effect. Although directly analogous to the corresponding temporal mechanisms, these spatial mechanisms involve different life history traits which suggest that the spatial storage effect should arise more commonly than the temporal storage effect and spatial relative nonlinearity should arise less commonly than temporal relative nonlinearity. Additional mechanisms occur in the spatial case due to spatial covariance between the finite rate of increase of a local population and its local abundance, which has no clear temporal analogue. A limited analysis of these additional mechanisms shows that they have similar properties to the storage effect and relative nonlinearity and potentially may be considered as enlargements of the earlier mechanisms. The rate of increase of a species perturbed to low density is used to quantify coexistence. A general quadratic approximation, which is exact in some important cases, divides this rate of increase into contributions from the various mechanisms above and admits no other mechanisms, suggesting that opportunities for coexistence in a spatially-variable environment are fully characterized by these mechanisms within this general model. Three spatially-implicit models are analyzed as illustrations of the general findings and of techniques using small variance approximations. The contributions to coexistence of the various mechanisms are expressed in terms of simple interpretable formulae. These spatially-implicit models include a model of an annual plant community, a spatial multispecies version of the lottery model, and a multispecies model of an insect community competing for spatially-patchy and ephemeral food. {\textcopyright} 2000 Academic Press.},

For the first experiment, eight blackgrass plants of different heights and number of ears were produced in a greenhouse with the help of different in sowing densities and nitrogen nutrition levels. At the beginning of seed shedding, the plants were placed outside, and seeds were gathered daily. Daily seed dispersal was analysed by fitting a Weibull equation to the number of seeds as a function of distance to the mother-plant. The second experiment was carried out in a field comprising winter barley and spring barley plots as well as bare soil. In each of these three parts, two isolated blackgrass plants were selected and seeds gathered with the help of small pots located along and across the crop rows at growing distances from the mother-plants. For both experiments, total seed dispersal was analysed by fitting a sum of two Weibull equations and analysing the estimated parameters as a function of blackgrass characteristics (plant height, number of ears per plants), seed characteristics (weight, presence of caryopsis, germination ability), crop cover (winter barley, spring barley, no crop) and direction (along or across crop rows). The dispersal equations were then introduced into a weed demography model, and blackgrass spread in time and in space was simulated for a field cultivated with different crops. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {Climate change is inducing deep modifications in species geographic ranges worldwide. However, the consequences of such changes on community structure are still poorly understood, particularly the impacts on food-web properties. Here, we propose a new framework, coupling species distribution and trophic models, to predict climate change impacts on food-web structure across the Mediterranean Sea. Sea surface temperature was used to determine the fish climate niches and their future distributions. Body size was used to infer trophic interactions between fish species. Our projections reveal that 54 fish species of 256 endemic and native species included in our analysis would disappear by 2080-2099 from the Mediterranean continental shelf. The number of feeding links between fish species would decrease on 73.4{\%} of the continental shelf. However, the connectance of the overall fish web would increase on average, from 0.26 to 0.29, mainly due to a differential loss rate of feeding links and species richness. This result masks a systematic decrease in predator generality, estimated here as the number of prey species, from 30.0 to 25.4. Therefore, our study highlights large-scale impacts of climate change on marine food-web structure with potential deep consequences on ecosystem functioning. However, these impacts will likely be highly heterogeneous in space, challenging our current understanding of climate change impact on local marine ecosystems.},

abstract = {Weed management must both control weed harmfulness for crop production and promote weed contribution to biodiversity as an essential component of biodiversity in agricultural landscapes. The objective of the present paper was to evaluate a large range of existing cropping systems to determine management rules for reconciling weed-related biodiversity and weed harmfulness, comparing 26 contrasting cropping systems identified via farm surveys in two contrasting French regions, Burgundy and Poitou-Charentes. These systems were simulated, using the weed dynamics model FlorSys which predicts weed flora dynamics over the years, depending on cropping system and pedoclimate. The simulated flora was translated into five weed harmfulness indicators (crop yield loss, harvest contamination, harvesting difficulty, field infestation, additional crop disease due to weeds) and five weed-related biodiversity indicators (weed species richness and equitability, weed-based trophic offer for birds, insects and pollinators). Cropping system performance was assessed with a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the 10 weed-impact indicators, followed by a hierarchical clustering analysis. Five contrasting profiles in terms of weed harmfulness and contribution to biodiversity were identified, combining different levels of weed harmfulness and biodiversity. To identify management strategies (i.e., combinations of cultural practices) for reaching these different performance profiles, tree-based regression and classification models (CART) were constructed to explain performance profiles as a function of cropping system descriptors and pedoclimatic variables. Ten management strategies were identified for reaching the five performance profiles. The most interesting performance profile, which minimized all harmfulness indicators (except harvest contamination and harvesting difficulty) and maximized all biodiversity indicators (except species richness), was reached by a single strategy type, consisting of low or no-till systems. Systems with cover crops and little or no mechanical weeding also reconciled most production and biodiversity goals. Multiple management pathways for reaching a given goal present the advantage of letting farmers choose the strategy most compatible with the objectives and constraints of their farm. The present results were obtained with annual weed species only, and taking into account the management of perennial weeds will probably modify the strategies. The same method was also applied to identify strategies for reconciling crop production, biodiversity and reduced herbicide use, though none of the investigated cropping systems was able to reconcile all three objectives, indicating that novel cropping systems must be designed specifically for this objective.},

The study sites were a 5.4ha isolated forest fragment and a small tree group situated 1.7km away, located in Paran$\alpha$ State, Brazil. In the forest fragment, 121 males, 99 females, 66 seedlings and 92 juveniles were mapped and genotyped, together with 210 seeds. In the tree group, nine male and two female adults were mapped and genotyped, together with 20 seeds. Paternity analysis within the forest fragment indicated that at least 4{\%} of the seeds, 3{\%} of the seedlings and 7{\%} of the juveniles were fertilized by pollen from trees in the adjacent group, and 6{\%} of the seeds were fertilized by pollen from trees outside these stands. The average pollination distance within the forest fragment was 83m; when the tree group was included the pollination distance was 2006m. The average number of effective pollen donors was estimated as 12.6. Mother-trees within the fragment could be assigned to all seedlings and juveniles, suggesting an absence of seed immigration. The distance of seedlings and juveniles from their assigned mother-trees ranged from 0.35 to 291m (with an average of 83m). Significant spatial genetic structure among adult trees, seedlings, and juveniles was detected up to 50m, indicating seed dispersal over a short distance. The effective pollination neighborhood ranged from 0.4 to 3.3ha. The results suggest that seed dispersal is restricted but that there is long-distance pollen dispersal between the forest fragment and the tree group; thus, the two stands of trees are not isolated. {\textcopyright} 2007 Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved.},

Available modelling methods are diverse, but analysis usually focuses on long-term dynamics that are unable to describe the complicated short-term time series that can arise even from simple models following ecological disturbances or perturbations. Recent interest in such transient dynamics has led to diverse methodologies for their quantification in density-independent, time-invariant population projection matrix (PPM) models, but the fragmented nature of this literature has stifled the widespread analysis of transients. We review the literature on transient analyses of linear PPM models and synthesise a coherent framework. We promote the use of standardised indices, and categorise indices according to their focus on either convergence times or transient population density, and on either transient bounds or case-specific transient dynamics. We use a large database of empirical PPM models to explore relationships between indices of transient dynamics. This analysis promotes the use of population inertia as a simple, versatile and informative predictor of transient population density, but criticises the utility of established indices of convergence times. Our findings should guide further development of analyses of transient population dynamics using PPMs or other empirical modelling techniques. {\textcopyright} 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

However, paucity of detailed re-measurement data of seedlings, saplings and small trees means that their demography is not well understood at large scales, and rarely represented in forest models in detail. In this study we quantify the effects of climate and density dependence on recruitment and juvenile growth and mortality rates of thirteen species measured in the Spanish Forest Inventory. Single-census sapling count data is used to constrain demographic parameters of a simple forest juvenile dynamics model based on the perfect plasticity approximation model (PPA) within a likelihood-free parameterisation method, Approximate Bayesian Computation. Our results highlight marked differences between species, and the important role of climate and stand structure, in controlling juvenile dynamics. Recruitment had a hump-shaped relationship with conspecific density, and for most species conspecific competition had a stronger negative effect than heterospecific competition. Mediterranean species showed on average higher mortality and lower growth rates than temperate species, and in low density stands recruitment and mortality rates were positively correlated. Under climate change our model predicted declines in recruitment rates for almost all species. Reliable predictive models of forest dynamics should include realistic representation of critical early life-stage processes and our approach demonstrates that existing coarse count data can be used to parameterise such models. Approximate Bayesian Computation may have wide application in many fields of ecology to unlock information about past processes from single survey observations.},

abstract = {Abstract Aim Linking local population dynamics and species distributions is crucial to predicting the impacts of climate change. Although many studies focus on the mean fitness of populations, theory shows that species distributions can be shaped by demographic stochasticity or population resilience. Here, we examine how mean fitness (measured by invasion rate), demographic stochasticity and resilience (measured by the ability to recover from disturbance) constrain populations at the edges compared with the climatic centre. Location Europe: Spain, France, Germany, Finland and Sweden. Period Forest inventory data used for fitting the models cover the period from 1985 to 2013. Major taxa Dominant European tree species; angiosperms and gymnosperms. Methods We developed dynamic population models covering the entire life cycle of 25 European tree species with climatically dependent recruitment models fitted to forest inventory data. We then ran simulations using integral projection and individual-based models to test how invasion rates, risk of stochastic extinction and ability to recover from stochastic disturbances differ between the centre and edges of the climatic niches of species. Results Results varied among species, but in general, demographic constraints were stronger at warm edges and for species in harsher climates. Conversely, recovery was more limiting at cold edges. In addition, we found that for several species, constraints at the edges were attributable to demographic stochasticity and capacity for recovery rather than mean fitness. Main conclusions Our results highlight that mean fitness is not the only mechanism at play at the edges; demographic stochasticity and population capacity to recover also matter for European tree species. To understand how climate change will drive species range shifts, future studies will need to analyse the interplay between population mean growth rate and stochastic demographic processes in addition to disturbances.},

abstract = {Pollen flow is a key biological process that connects plant populations, preventing genetic impoverishment and inbreeding. Pollen-mediated long-distance dispersal (LDD) events are especially important for plant species in increasingly fragmented landscapes. Patterns of pollen dispersal were directly estimated and dispersal kernels modelled in an experimental population of Ranunculus bulbosus and Trifolium montanum to determine the potential for LDD. Eight and 11 microsatellite markers were used for R. bulbosus and T. montanum, respectively, to run a likelihood-based paternity analysis on randomly chosen offspring (Ntotal=180 per species) from five maternal plants. High rates of selfing were found in R. bulbosus (average 45.7{\%}), while no selfing was observed in T. montanum. The majority (60{\%}) of mating events occurred at very short distances: the median of the observed dispersal distances was 0.8m in both species, and the average distances were 15.9 and 10.3m in R. bulbosus and T. montanum, respectively. Modelling the pollen dispersal kernel with four different distribution functions (exponential-power, geometric, 2Dt and Weibull) indicated that the best fit for both species was given by a Weibull function. Yet, the tail of the T. montanum pollen dispersal kernel was thinner than in R. bulbosus, suggesting that the probability for LDD is higher in the latter species. Even though the majority of pollen dispersal occurred across short distances, the detection of several mating events up to 362m (R. bulbosus) and 324m (T. montanum) suggests that pollen flow may be sufficient to ensure population connectivity in these herb species across fragmented grasslands in Swiss agricultural landscapes. {\textcopyright} 2012 German Botanical Society and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands.},

A key example is the controversy over the extent to which temperate tree distributions and diversity patterns reflect postglacial dispersal limitation. Here, we focus on Central and Northern Europe, and show that recent estimates of tree migration rates {\textless} 100 m year-1 imply that many species have probably not reached equilibrium with climate in this region. We then demonstrate that geographical accessibility from glacial refuges explains 78{\%} of the geographical variation in the region's tree diversity and is a much stronger diversity predictor than climate. Finally, we show that realistic estimates of migration rates can be derived from the observed tree diversity pattern by assuming it to be purely dispersal driven. In conclusion, the tree diversity pattern in Central and Northern Europe could, to a large extent, be a result of postglacial dispersal limitation. {\textcopyright} 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

abstract = {Many plants depend on frugivorous animals for the dispersal of their seeds. However, it is only poorly known whether regional differences in frugivore diversity have consequences for seed dispersal, seedling establishment, and the spatial distribution of seedlings and trees. This comparative study of seed dispersal investigated the consequences of regional differences in frugivore diversity for two tree species of the genus Commiphora. C. harveyi was studied in South Africa where avian frugivore diversity is high, C. guillaumini was studied in Madagascar where the avian fruigivore community is depauperate. At both study sites, the percentages of handled and dispersed seeds in Commiphora trees were quantified by fruit traps, and visitation rates, seed handling rates and dispersal rates were quantified for each animal species for two consecutive years. Seedlings were mapped and the spatial distribution of trees quantified. At both study sites, fruits were mainly eaten by birds. The total percentage of dispersed seeds in South Africa was significantly higher than in Madagascar (70.8{\%} vs. 7.9{\%}) because there was a lack of effective dispersers that swallowed seeds in Madagascar. Seed dispersal benefit, i.e. the increase in the probability of becoming established as a seedling away,from parent trees due to dispersal was much higher in Madagascar (80 times higher probability) compared to South Africa (6 times higher). Corresponding with the different dispersal percentages, seedlings in South Africa were found at relatively large distances from the nearest Commiphora tree (median distance=21.0 m), whereas in Madagascar seedlings were found mostly under and close to the nearest Commiphora tree (median distance=0.9 m). Finally, Commiphora trees in the Malagasy study site were clumped, but were more randomly distributed in the South African study site. These results suggest that regional differences in frugivore diversity and behaviour strongly affect seed dispersal of trees, seedling establishment and the spatial distribution of seedlings and trees},

abstract = {Ecologists have limited understanding of how geographic variation in forest biomass arises from differences in growth and mortality at continental to global scales. Using forest inventories from across North America, we partitioned continental-scale variation in biomass growth and mortality rates of 49 tree species groups into (1) species-independent spatial effects and (2) inherent differences in demographic performance among species. Spatial factors that were separable from species composition explained 83{\%} and 51{\%} of the respective variation in growth and mortality. Moderate additional variation in mortality (26{\%}) was attributable to differences in species composition. Age-dependent biomass models showed that variation in forest biomass can be explained primarily by spatial gradients in growth that were unrelated to species composition. Species-dependent patterns of mortality explained additional variation in biomass, with forests supporting less biomass when dominated by species that are highly susceptible to competition (e.g. Populus spp.) or to biotic disturbances (e.g. Abies balsamea).},

abstract = {With over 90,000 miles of road in Indiana, it is important that adjoining vegetation be maintained for safety concerns, road structure maintenance and aesthetics. Mowing is currently the main form of vegetation management on INDOT (Indiana Department of Transportation) roadside. Ever-increasing fuel costs and the high labor demand associated with mowing leads to millions of dollars spent on in-house and contract mowing cycles each year. Drastic cost reductions can be achieved by reducing mowing cycles through the incorporation of other management tools including herbicide and native plantings. This study provides data on six herbicide tank mixtures (Milestone/Escort; Milestone/Escort/Plateau; Perspective; Perspective/Plateau; Viewpoint/Streamline; and 2,4-D/Escort/Plateau) and two mowing cycles (one-cycle and two-cycle) at six sites across the state. All herbicide treatments decreased broadleaf cover better than mowing treatments. Herbicide treatments containing Plateau, a plant growth regulator that retards cool-season grass growth, had the shortest grass height. Herbicide mixtures without Plateau were still shorter than mowing plots due to the seedhead suppression qualities found in the selective broadleaf herbicides. A cost savings of over 40{\%} is achieved with one application of herbicide in lieu of one cycle of mowing. Further cost savings can be achieved through the planting of native vegetation, which was the focus of the second portion of this project. Four native seed mixes (western wheat, short grass, tall grass and short grass with forbs) were analyzed for use on right-of-ways. Successful native plantings have reduced maintenance costs for many DOTs across the country by eliminating mowing and herbicide needs. Drought and persistent weeds at study sites resulted in a sparse covering of native species during the year after planting. This is not uncommon for native roadside planting studies since many native grass species require two to three growing seasons to establish.},

abstract = {Understanding the processes driving community assembly is a central theme in ecology, yet this topic is mar- ginally studied in food webs. Bioenergetic models have been instrumental in the development of food web theory, using allometric relationships with body mass, temperature, and ex- plicit energy flows. However, despite their popularity, little is known about the constraints they impose on assembly dynam- ics. In this study, we build on classical consumer–resource theory to analyze the implications of the assembly process on trait selection in food webs. Using bioenergetic models, we investigate the selective pressure on body mass and con- version efficiency and its dependence on trophic structure and temperature.We find that the selection exerted by exploitative competition is highly sensitive to how the energy fluxes are modeled. However, the addition of a trophic level consistently selects for smaller body masses of primary producers. An increase in temperature triggers important cascading changes in food webs via a reduction of producer biomass, which is detrimental to herbivore persistence. This affects the structure of trait distributions, which in turn strengthens the exploitative competition and the selective pressure on traits. Our results suggest that greater attention should be devoted to the effects of food web assembly on trait selection to understand the diversity and the functioning of real food webs, as well as their possible response to ongoing global changes.},

abstract = {An increasing number of studies have reported on forest declines and vegetation shifts triggered by drought. In the Swiss Rhone valley (Valais), one of the driest inner-Alpine regions, the species composition in low elevation forests is changing: The sub-boreal Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) dominating the dry forests is showing high mortality rates. Concurrently the sub-Mediterranean pubescent oak (Quercus pubescens Willd.) has locally increased in abundance. However, it remains unclear whether this local change in species composition is part of a larger-scale vegetation shift. To study variability in mortality and regeneration in these dry forests we analysed data from the Swiss national forest inventory (NFI) on a regular grid between 1983 and 2003, and combined it with annual mortality data from a monitoring site. Pine mortality was found to be highest at low elevation (below 1000 m a.s.l.). Annual variation in pine mortality was correlated with a drought index computed for the summer months prior to observed tree death. A generalized linear mixed-effects model indicated for the NFI data increased pine mortality on dryer sites with high stand competition, particularly for small-diameter trees. Pine regeneration was low in comparison to its occurrence in the overstorey, whereas oak regeneration was comparably abundant. Although both species regenerated well at dry sites, pine regeneration was favoured at cooler sites at higher altitude and oak regeneration was more frequent at warmer sites, indicating a higher adaptation potential of oaks under future warming. Our results thus suggest that an extended shift in species composition is actually occurring in the pine forests in the Valais. The main driving factors are found to be climatic variability, particularly drought, and variability in stand structure and topography. Thus, pine forests at low elevations are developing into oak forests with unknown consequences for these ecosystems and their goods and services.},

As sessile long-living plants, they need this high level of genetic variation for adaptation to highly variable environmental conditions. A set of population genetic processes such as the mating system, gene flow, selection, and migration determine the genetic composition of a tree population. First we will give an introduction and overview on the most important processes and their impact on the genetic diversity of tropical trees, and then we will go in more details for some of the processes. The genetic diversity is of fundamental function for the stability of forest ecosystems. Thus adequate measures on gene conservation are very important. We will cover this topic with a specific chapter. More recently with the advance of genomics and molecular genetics, we have a broad set of molecular markers in hand for diagnostic purposes. We highlight as one important application the use of gene markers and DNA bar coding for tree species identification and as a tool to fight against illegal logging.

abstract = {Climate change is inducing deep modifications in local communities worldwide as a consequence of individualistic species range shifts. Understanding how complex interaction networks will be reorganized under climate change represents a major challenge in the fields of ecology and biogeography. However, forecasting the potential effects of climate change on local communities, and more particularly on food-web structure, requires the consideration of highly structuring processes, such as trophic interactions. A major breakthrough is therefore expected by combining predictive models integrating habitat selection processes, the physiological limits of marine species and their trophic interactions. In this study, we forecasted the potential impacts of climate change on the local food-web structure of the highly threatened Gulf of Gabes ecosystem located in the south of the Mediterranean Sea. We coupled the climatic envelope and habitat models to an allometric niche food web model, hence taking into account the different processes acting at regional (climate) and local scales (habitat selection and trophic interactions). Our projections under the A2 climate change scenario showed that future food webs would be composed of smaller species with fewer links, resulting in a decrease of connectance, generality, vulnerability and mean trophic level of communities and an increase of the average path length, which may have large consequences on ecosystem functioning. The unified framework presented here, by connecting food-web ecology, biogeography and seascape ecology, allows the exploration of spatial aspects of interspecific interactions under climate change and improves our current understanding of climate change impacts on local marine food webs.},

abstract = {Technological advances have enabled a new class of multivariate models for ecology, with the potential now to specify a statistical model for abundances jointly across many taxa, to simultaneously explore interactions across taxa and the response of abundance to environmental variables. Joint models can be used for several purposes of interest to ecologists, including estimating patterns of residual correlation across taxa, ordination, multivariate inference about environmental effects and environment-by-trait interactions, accounting for missing predictors, and improving predictions in situations where one can leverage knowledge of some species to predict others. We demonstrate this by example and discuss recent computation tools and future directions. Many ecological questions require the joint analysis of abundances collected simultaneously across many taxonomic groups, and, if organisms are identified using modern tools such as metabarcoding, their number can be in the thousands.While historically such data have been analyzed using ad hoc algorithms, it is now possible to fully specify joint statistical models for abundance using multivariate extensions of generalized linear mixed models.These modern 'joint modeling' approaches allow the study of correlation patterns across taxa, at the same time as studying environmental response, to tease the two apart.Latent variable models are an especially exciting tool that has recently been used for ordination as well as for studying the factors driving co-occurrence.},

abstract = {Greenhouse gas emissions have significantly altered global climate, and will continue to do so in the future. Increases in the frequency, duration, and/or severity of drought and heat stress associated with climate change could fundamentally alter the composition, structure, and biogeography of forests in many regions. Of particular concern are potential increases in tree mortality associated with climate-induced physiological stress and interactions with other climate-mediated processes such as insect outbreaks and wildfire. Despite this risk, existing projections of tree mortality are based on models that lack functionally realistic mortality mechanisms, and there has been no attempt to track observations of climate-driven tree mortality globally. Here we present the first global assessment of recent tree mortality attributed to drought and heat stress. Although episodic mortality occurs in the absence of climate change, studies compiled here suggest that at least some of the world's forested ecosystems already may be responding to climate change and raise concern that forests may become increasingly vulnerable to higher background tree mortality rates and die-off in response to future warming and drought, even in environments that are not normally considered water-limited. This further suggests risks to ecosystem services, including the loss of sequestered forest carbon and associated atmospheric feedbacks. Our review also identifies key information gaps and scientific uncertainties that currently hinder our ability to predict tree mortality in response to climate change and emphasizes the need for a globally coordinated observation system. Overall, our review reveals the potential for amplified tree mortality due to drought and heat in forests worldwide.},

abstract = {Aim For this study, we wanted to evaluate the reproductive potential of northern red maple (Acer rubrum L.) populations to identify the possible factors responsible for the scattered distribution pattern of these northern populations. Location Samara production and long-term establishment of seedlings were observed along a north-south transect crossing the transition zone between continuous and discontinuous stands of red maple (47o80'-49o27' N) in western Quebec. Methods Eleven populations of red maple were selected along a latitudinal gradient extending to the northern limit of the species. Seed traps were placed in each stand and distributed under the canopy of mature red maple trees. Seed abundance was tracked for 6 years from 1988 to 1993. Phenological observations were made in 1992 and 1993 at Roquemaure (Roq), a site located at the centre of the latitudinal gradient. Red maple trees were randomly selected within the population; counts of flower buds, pollinated buds and samaras produced were made in 1992-93. Samaras were collected from each branch immediately before dispersal and counted. During the summer of 1987, seedlings ({\textless} 1 cm d.b.h.) were collected and aged at each site in twenty 1 m2 quadrants and age of the seedlings ({\textless} 1 cm d.b.h.) was determined by counting the annual scars left by terminal buds. Results Samaras were produced even at the northern limit but large yearly variations were observed. Over the 6-year period we counted 3 years (1989, 1990, 1993) when samara production was high, and 3 years (1988, 1991, 1992) when production was low. Phenological observations indicate that the occurrence of spring frosts at the time of flower bud flushing could contribute to decreasing the abundance of seeds. The age structure of southern localities had a relatively constant production of seedlings, as indicated by an inverse J-shaped distribution. However, the five northernmost localities show sporadic recruitment. Main conclusions Populations at the northern limit are maintained essentially through vegetative reproduction and infrequent sexual recruitment. Our results indicate that regeneration within established stands through sexual recruitment is possible in all of the populations we studied. This potential becomes very low at more northerly sites and sexual reproduction alone would be unlikely to ensure successful stand regeneration. Without major disturbances in those stands, shade tolerant conifer species such as balsam fir (Abies balsamea) or black spruce (Picea mariana) would readily dominate the canopy. The discontinuous distribution of red maple stands at the northern limit is the consequence of either a random colonization of few sites during a better climatic period or remnants of a much larger distribution that has been constrained because of climatic deterioration},

abstract = {Summary: Anthropogenic global change compromises forest resilience, with profound impacts to ecosystem functions and services. This synthesis paper reflects on the current understanding of forest resilience and potential tipping points under environmental change and explores challenges to assessing responses using experiments, observations and models. Forests are changing over a wide range of spatio-temporal scales, but it is often unclear whether these changes reduce resilience or represent a tipping point. Tipping points may arise from interactions across scales, as processes such as climate change, land-use change, invasive species or deforestation gradually erode resilience and increase vulnerability to extreme events. Studies covering interactions across different spatio-temporal scales are needed to further our understanding. Combinations of experiments, observations and process-based models could improve our ability to project forest resilience and tipping points under global change. We discuss uncertainties in changing CO2 concentration and quantifying tree mortality as examples. Synthesis. As forests change at various scales, it is increasingly important to understand whether and how such changes lead to reduced resilience and potential tipping points. Understanding the mechanisms underlying forest resilience and tipping points would help in assessing risks to ecosystems and presents opportunities for ecosystem restoration and sustainable forest management.

abstract = {Inbreeding depression—reduced fitness caused by mating among relatives—is well documented for a wide range of taxa (Charlesworth and Charlesworth 1987; Ralls et al. 1988; Thornhill 1993; Saccheri et al. 1996; Ballou 1997; Weste- meier et al. 1998; Antolin 1999; Madsen et al. 1999; Morjan et al. 1999; Weeks et al. 1999; van Oosterhout et al. 2000). The most likely mechanism of inbreeding depression is the expression of deleterious recessive alleles in the offspring of close relatives (Charlesworth and Charlesworth 1987; Lande 1995; Ballou 1997; Bijlsma et al. 1997;Tanaka 1998).Amuch more controversial issue is the extent to which inbreeding depression influences the dynamics of natural populations, including the risk of population extinction. Following a period in the 1970s when much emphasis in conservation biology was placed on genetic causes of extinction (e.g., Frankel and Soule´ 1981), a consensus emerged in the 1980s that emphasized the primary role of ecological factors in reducing population size and causing the ultimate demise of small populations (e.g., Lande 1988). Nevertheless, in- tegration of ecological, genetic and environmental factors remains critically important for a thorough understanding of the risk of population extinction (e.g., Dunham et al. 1999). Though the primary role of ecological factors in pop- ulation extinction is now widely accepted, some results, especially on plant populations, suggest that inbreeding and genetic drift in small populations may influence dy- namics and ultimately increase the risk of population ex- tinction (Charlesworth and Charlesworth 1987; Newman and Pilson 1997). Observations on reptiles and birds (Kel- ler et al. 1994; Madsen et al. 1996, 1999; Westemeier et al. 1998) and results from small-scale field experiments on mammals and plants (Jime´nez et al. 1994; Newman and Pilson 1997) also indicate that inbreeding may significantly increase extinction risk. Recent theoretical studies have suggested that slightly deleterious alleles may accumulate in small populations to the point that their impact on population dynamics cannot be ignored (Hedrick 1994; Frankham 1995; Lynch et al. 1995), though an experi- mental test using Drosophila failed to support this genetic “meltdown” model (Gilligan et al. 1997). In a previous observational study on the Glanville frit- illary butterfly (Melitaea cinxia), Saccheri et al. (1998) found that the extinction risk of small local populations increased with the degree of inbreeding, which they in- ferred from the average heterozygosity of the field pop- ulations. Laboratory results showed a reduction in several fitness components, such as larval survival, adult longevity, and egg-hatching rate, after just one generation of full-sib mating (Saccheri et al. 1998). Because the Glanville frit- illary metapopulation is structured into many very small local populations, which often consist of just one family group of larvae (Hanski 1999), the observation that in- breeding increases extinction rate is not very surprising. The purpose of this study was to experimentally test the hypothesis that inbreeding depression increases the risk of extinction of small populations. Melitaea cinxia is an appropriate species for such an experiment because of its metapopulation structure (Hanski 1999) and be- cause of the previous observational findings (Saccheri et al. 1998).We established experimental populations in the field from laboratory-reared families of M. cinxia. Half of the populations were started with offspring of full-sib matings; the rest, with offspring of outbred matings. We recorded the subsequent performance of these experi- mental populations.},

abstract = {Classical tree neighborhood models use size variables acting at point distances. In a new approach here, trees were spatially extended as a function of their crown sizes, represented impressionistically as points within crown areas. Extension was accompanied by plasticity in the form of crown removal or relocation under the overlap of taller trees. Root systems were supposedly extended in a similar manner. For the 38 most abundant species in the focal size class (10–{\textless}100 cm stem girth) in two 4-ha plots at Danum (Sabah), for periods P1 (1986–1996) and P2 (1996–2007), stem growth rate and tree survival were individually regressed against stem size, and neighborhood conspecific (CON) and heterospecific (HET) basal areas within incremented steps in radius. Model parameters were critically assessed, and statistical robustness in the modeling was set by randomization testing. Classical and extended models differed importantly in their outcomes. Crown extension weakened the relationship of CON effect on growth versus plot species' abundance, showing that models without plasticity overestimated negative density dependence. A significant negative trend of difference in CON effects on growth (P2−P1) versus CON or HET effect on survival in P1 was strongest with crown extension. Model outcomes did not then support an explanation of CON and HET effects being due to (asymmetric) competition for light alone. An alternative hypothesis is that changes in CON effects on small trees, largely incurred by a drought phase (relaxing light limitation) in P2, and following the more shaded (suppressing) conditions in P1, were likely due to species-specific (symmetric) root competition and mycorrhizal processes. The very high variation in neighborhood composition and abundances led to a strong “neighborhood stochasticity” and hence to largely idiosyncratic species' responses. A need to much better understand the roles of rooting structure and processes at the individual tree level was highlighted.},

abstract = {Many landscape genetic studies promise results that can be applied in conservation management. However, only few landscape genetic studies have been used by practitioners. Here, we identified scientific topics in landscape genetics that need to be addressed before results can more successfully be applied in conservation management. For each topic, weaknesses of common practice in landscape genetic analysis are described by presenting examples from current studies and further recommendations for improvements are outlined. First, we suggest matching the extent of the study area with those of conservation management units and the study species' dispersal potential when designing landscape genetic studies. Second, the quality of the underlying statistical models should be optimised, and models should include variables that are useful for management implementation. Third, to further improve the applicability of landscape genetic studies, thresholds for landscape effects on gene flow should be identified. Fourth, landscape genetic models could be used for the development of conservation planning tools, which ideally also incorporate the above described thresholds. Fifth and as discussed in earlier studies, the use of multiple species and replication at the landscape scale is recommended. Although it appears that only few landscape genetic studies have been applied in practical management until now, examples presented in this article show that landscape genetic methods can provide important information to formulate concrete management implications. Thus, addressing the above-mentioned scientific topics in landscape genetic studies would enhance the benefits of their results for practitioners.},

However, more complex dynamics are possible and may lead to memory effects and alternate unstable states. We develop graphical and analytic methods for assessing these scenarios and show that these dynamics can appear in even simple models. The overall implications are that (1) complex community dynamics may be common and (2) detailed knowledge of past climate change and community states will often be necessary yet sometimes insufficient to make predictions of a community's future state.},

abstract = {Increasing frequency of extremely dry and hot summers in some regions emphasise the need for silvicultural approaches to increase the drought tolerance of existing forests in the short term, before long-term adaptation through species changes may be possible. The aim of this meta-analysis was to assess the potential of thinning for improving tree performance during and after drought. We used results from 23 experiments that employed different thinning intensities including an unthinned control and focused on the response variables: radial growth, carbon- and oxygen-isotopes in tree-rings and pre-dawn leaf-water potential. We found that thinning effects on the growth response to drought differed between broadleaves and conifers, although these findings are based on few studies only in broadleaved forests. Thinning helped to mitigate growth reductions during drought in broadleaves, most likely via increases of soil water availability. In contrast, in conifers, comparable drought-related growth reductions and increases of water-use efficiency were observed in all treatments but thinning improved the post-drought recovery and resilience of radial growth. Results of meta-regression analysis indicate that benefits of both moderate and heavy thinning for growth performance following drought (recovery and resilience) decrease with time since the last intervention. Further, growth resistance during drought became smaller with stand age while the rate of growth recovery following drought increased over time irrespective of treatment. Heavy but not moderate thinning helped to avoid an age-related decline in medium-term growth resilience to drought. For both closed and very open stands, growth performance during drought improved with increasing site aridity but for the same stands growth recovery and resilience following drought was reduced with increasing site aridity. This synthesis of experiments from a wide geographical range has demonstrated that thinning, in particular heavy thinning, is a suitable approach to improve the growth response of remaining trees to drought in both conifers and broadleaves but the underlying processes differ and need to be considered.},

abstract = {The idiosyncratic behaviours of seed dispersers are important contributors to plant spatial associations and genetic structures. In this study, we used a combination of field, molecular and spatial studies to examine the connections between seed dispersal and the spatial and genetic structures of a dominant neotropical palm Attalea phalerata. Field observation and genetic parentage analysis both indicated that the majority of A. phalerata seeds were dispersed locally over short distances ({\textless}30 m from the maternal tree). Spatial and genetic structures between adults and seedlings were consistent with localized and short-distance seed dispersal. Dispersal contributed to spatial associations among maternal sibling seedlings and strong spatial and genetic structures in both seedlings dispersed near ({\textless}10 m) and away ({\textgreater}10 m) from maternal palms. Seedlings were also spatially aggregated with juveniles. These patterns are probably associated with the dispersal of seeds by rodents and the survival of recruits at specific microsites or neighbourhoods over successive fruiting periods. Our cross-cohort analyses found palms in older cohorts and cohort pairs were associated with a lower proportion of offspring and sibling neighbours and exhibited weaker spatial and genetic structures. Such patterns are consistent with increased distance- and density-dependent mortality over time among palms dispersed near maternal palms or siblings. The integrative approaches used for this study allowed us to infer the importance of seed dispersal activities in maintaining the aggregated distribution and significant genetic structures among A. phalerata palms. We further conclude that distance- and density-dependent mortality is a key postdispersal process regulating this palm population.},

abstract = {Extinction debt refers to delayed species extinctions expected as a consequence of ecosystem perturbation. Quantifying such extinctions and investigating long-term consequences of perturbations has proven challenging, because perturbations are not isolated and occur across various spatial and temporal scales, from local habitat losses to global warming. Additionally, the relative importance of eco-evolutionary processes varies across scales, because levels of ecological organization, i.e. individuals, (meta)populations and (meta)communities, respond hierarchically to perturbations. To summarize our current knowledge of the scales and mechanisms influencing extinction debts, we reviewed recent empirical, theoretical and methodological studies addressing either the spatio–temporal scales of extinction debts or the eco-evolutionary mechanisms delaying extinctions. Extinction debts were detected across a range of ecosystems and taxonomic groups, with estimates ranging from 9 to 90{\%} of current species richness. The duration over which debts have been sustained varies from 5 to 570 yr, and projections of the total period required to settle a debt can extend to 1000 yr. Reported causes of delayed extinctions are 1) life-history traits that prolong individual survival, and 2) population and metapopulation dynamics that maintain populations under deteriorated conditions. Other potential factors that may extend survival time such as microevolutionary dynamics, or delayed extinctions of interaction partners, have rarely been analyzed. Therefore, we propose a roadmap for future research with three key avenues: 1) the microevolutionary dynamics of extinction processes, 2) the disjunctive loss of interacting species and 3) the impact of multiple regimes of perturbation on the payment of debts. For their ability to integrate processes occurring at different levels of ecological organization, we highlight mechanistic simulation models as tools to address these knowledge gaps and to deepen our understanding of extinction dynamics.},

abstract = {Extinction debts can result from many types of habitat changes involving mechanisms other than metapopulation processes. This is a fact that most recent literature on extinction debts pays little attention to. We argue that extinction debts can arise because (i) individuals survive in resistant life-cycle stages long after habitat quality change, (ii) stochastic extinctions of populations that have become small are not immediate, and (iii) metapopulations survive long after that connectivity has decreased if colonization-extinction dynamics is slow. A failure to distinguish between these different mechanisms and to simultaneously consider both the size of the extinction debt and the relaxation time hampers our understanding of how extinction debts arise and our ability to prevent ultimate extinctions. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

To minimize global biodiversity losses, conservationists need to identify those species that are likely to be most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. In this Review, we summarize different currencies used for assessing species' climate change vulnerability. We describe three main approaches used to derive these currencies (correlative, mechanistic and trait-based), and their associated data requirements, spatial and temporal scales of application and modelling methods. We identify strengths and weaknesses of the approaches and highlight the sources of uncertainty inherent in each method that limit projection reliability. Finally, we provide guidance for conservation practitioners in selecting the most appropriate approach(es) for their planning needs and highlight priority areas for further assessments.},

abstract = {Recent research has highlighted interdependencies between dispersal and other life-history traits, i.e. dispersal syndromes, thereby revealing constraints on the evolution of dispersal and opportunities for improved ability to predict dispersal by considering suites of dispersal-related traits. This review adds to the growing list of life-history traits linked to spatial dispersal by emphasising the interdependence between dispersal through space and time, i.e. life-history diversity that distributes individuals into separate reproductive events. We reviewed the literature that has simultaneously investigated spatial and temporal dispersal to examine the prediction that traits of these two dispersal strategies are negatively correlated. Our results suggest that negative covariation is widely anticipated from theory. Empirical studies often reported evidence of weak negative covariation, although more complicated patterns were also evident, including across levels of biological organisation. Existing literature has largely focused on plants with dormancy capability, one or two phases of the dispersal process (emigration and/or transfer) and a single level of biological organisation (theory: individual; empirical: species). We highlight patterns of covariation across levels of organisation and conclude with a discussion of the consequences of dispersal through space and time and future research areas that should improve our understanding of dispersal-related life-history syndromes.},

abstract = {Paternity analysis based on eight microsatellite loci was used to investigate pollen and seed dispersal patterns of the dioecious wind-pollinated tree, Araucaria angustifolia. The study sites were a 5.4ha isolated forest fragment and a small tree group situated 1.7km away, located in Paran$\alpha$ State, Brazil. In the forest fragment, 121 males, 99 females, 66 seedlings and 92 juveniles were mapped and genotyped, together with 210 seeds. In the tree group, nine male and two female adults were mapped and genotyped, together with 20 seeds. Paternity analysis within the forest fragment indicated that at least 4{\%} of the seeds, 3{\%} of the seedlings and 7{\%} of the juveniles were fertilized by pollen from trees in the adjacent group, and 6{\%} of the seeds were fertilized by pollen from trees outside these stands. The average pollination distance within the forest fragment was 83m; when the tree group was included the pollination distance was 2006m. The average number of effective pollen donors was estimated as 12.6. Mother-trees within the fragment could be assigned to all seedlings and juveniles, suggesting an absence of seed immigration. The distance of seedlings and juveniles from their assigned mother-trees ranged from 0.35 to 291m (with an average of 83m). Significant spatial genetic structure among adult trees, seedlings, and juveniles was detected up to 50m, indicating seed dispersal over a short distance. The effective pollination neighborhood ranged from 0.4 to 3.3ha. The results suggest that seed dispersal is restricted but that there is long-distance pollen dispersal between the forest fragment and the tree group; thus, the two stands of trees are not isolated. {\textcopyright} 2007 Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A fundamental goal of ecological research is to understand and model how processes generate patterns so that if conditions change, changes in the patterns can be predicted. Different approaches have been proposed for modelling species assemblage, but their use to predict spatial patterns of species richness and other community attributes over a range of spatial and temporal scales remains challenging. Different methods emphasize different processes of structuring communities and different goals. In this review, we focus on models that were developed for generating spatially explicit predictions of communities, with a particular focus on species richness, composition, relative abundance and related attributes. We first briefly describe the concepts and theories that span the different drivers of species assembly. A combination of abiotic processes and biotic mechanisms are thought to influence the community assembly process. In this review, we describe four categories of drivers: (i) historical and evolutionary, (ii) environmental, (iii)biotic,and(iv ) stochastic. We discuss the different modelling approaches proposed or applied at the community level and examine them from different standpoints, i.e. the theoretical bases, the drivers included, the source data, and the expected outputs, with special emphasis on conservation needs under climate change. We also highlight the most promising novelties, possible shortcomings, and potential extensions of existing methods. Finally, we present new approaches to model and predict species assemblages by reviewing promising ‘integrative frameworks' and views that seek to incorporate all drivers of community assembly into a unique modelling workflow. We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of these new solutions and how they may hasten progress in community-level modelling.},

abstract = {Aim: In order to mitigate the ecological, economical and social consequences of future climate change, we must understand and quantify the response of vegetation to short-term climate anomalies. There is currently no model that quantifies vegetation resistance and resilience at a global scale while simultaneously taking climate variability into account. The goals of this study were therefore to develop a standardized indicator of short-term vegetation resilience and resistance to drought and temperature anomalies, and to improve our understanding of vegetation resistance and resilience in drought-sensitive areas by linking metrics of vegetation stability to the percentage of tree cover, non-tree vegetation and bare soil. Location: Global. Methods: The deviation of vegetation behaviour from expectations was quantified using anomalies in the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and modelled as a function of (1) past NDVI anomalies, (2) an instantaneous drought indicator and (3) temperature anomalies. Metrics of resistance and resilience were then extracted from the model and related to the percentages of bare soil, non-tree vegetation and tree cover. Results: Comparisons of the globally derived resilience and resistance metrics showed low resilience and low resistance to drought in semi-arid areas, low resistance to negative temperature anomalies in high-latitude areas, and low resistance to positive temperature anomalies in the Sahel and Australia. In drought-sensitive areas, resilience was highest for vegetation types with 3-20{\%} bare soil and 5-15{\%} tree cover. Main conclusions: Our ARx model is the first to simultaneously derive vegetation resistance and resilience metrics at a global scale, explicitly taking into account the spatial variability of short-term climate anomalies and data reliability. Its results highlight the impact of tree cover, non-tree vegetation and bare soil on vegetation resilience.},

abstract = {hierarchical generalised linear model (also known as a generalised linear mixed effects model GLMM) using REML estimation, using R package lme4 .... we bring together the fields of species distribution modelling and functional trait ecology with hierarchical modelling by explicitly incorporating traits into a multi-species distribution model. We combined traits from the leaf-height-seed strategy scheme (specific leaf area (SLA), plant height and seed mass) with a distribution model for 20 eucalypt taxa in Victoria, Australia. The key insight of this approach is how traits modulate species responses to environmental gradients. The strongest link was between SLA and percent rock cover (species with low SLA had positive responses to rockiness, whereas high SLA species responded negatively to rockiness). We found evidence for complex yet potentially important interactions. For instance, the probability of species occurrence increased with rainfall and solar radiation on average yet the response varied depending on species height and SLA. Tall species were predicted to increase with rainfall and solar radiation across the range of SLA values (tall species with low SLA were especially sensitive to rainfall). Short species responded positively to rainfall and solar radiation only if they had low SLA. This framework readily accounts for interactions between combinations of traits and environmental variables unlike multi-step approaches. Further application of this concept will contribute to a generalized mechanistic understanding of how traits influence species distributions along environmental gradients, with implications for understanding the response of species to global change.},

As part of PREPA, the government established a compensatory system intended to provide compensation to persons injured by countermeasures used during a public health emergency. Although the Act provides for a compensation fund, it fails to allocate monies for that fund. Thus, in the absence of further congressional action, PREPA will not provide compensation to those injured by countermeasures. Failing to assure the American public of a compensation program constitutes bad public policy and risks inspiring potential vaccinees to refuse necessary drugs. Additionally, arguments as to the constitutionality of the Act exist should Congress fail to adequately fund the program, and the existence of those arguments undermines the purpose of the Act-namely to assure pharmaceutical manufacturers that they will not be sued into oblivion should they attempt to aid national pandemic protection. In addition to detailing both the Act and the statutory precedent for congressional attempts to spur biodefense, this Article addresses important issues of healthcare, tort, and constitutional law that will continue to manifest themselves in this new era of bioterrorism.},

Here, we introduce the concept of keystone communities (and ecosystems) within metacommunities (and metaecosystems). We define keystone and burden communities as communities with impacts disproportionately large (positive or negative respectively) relative to their weight in the metacommunity. We show how a simple metric, based on the effects of single-community removals, can characterise communities along a 'keystoneness' axis. We illustrate the usefulness of this approach with examples from two different theoretical models. We further distinguish environmental heterogeneity from species trait heterogeneity as determinants of keystoneness. We suggest that the concept of keystone communities/ecosystems will be highly beneficial, not only as a fundamental step towards understanding species interactions in a spatial context, but also as a tool for the management of disturbed landscapes.},

abstract = {Aims
Distribution and abundance patterns of species arise from the
spatiotemporal dynamics of demographic processes. Population rates of
birth, death, growth and patterns of dispersal are, in turn, influenced
by environmental conditions and biotic interactions. However, current
approaches for modelling large-scale geographical patterns often bypass
these simple premises. Centred in the mainland territory of Spain and
using Pinus halepensis as a case study, our goal was to gain insight
into the main drivers affecting local demographic processes, and how
large-scale distribution and abundance patterns are shaped by these
local variations in vital rates.
Methods
We applied the integral projection methodology to develop a spatially
explicit demographic model of tree species in mainland Spain, using
individual-level data from a national forest inventory. In our integral
projection model, environmental conditions and competitive interactions
influence the survival, growth and reproduction of trees, and we model
explicitly the dynamic colonization of new patches. With this framework,
the projected distribution and abundance patterns of P. halepensis up to
2090 were evaluated under two different climate scenarios.
Important Findings
When environmental conditions were kept constant, populations tended to
decrease in net number of adults and to increase in net basal area, thus
consisting in fewer and bigger individuals. Accounting for climate
change in our simulations exacerbated the trend in mortality, causing
widespread losses in number of trees, and few locations maintained
populations of {\textgreater}100 adult individuals per hectare. The expected increase
in mortality under climate change, on the other hand, prompted a higher
degree of regeneration via the release of niche space, although not
enough to maintain current abundance levels. Colonization spatial
patterns did not vary significantly with climatic conditions, but the
species was able to increase its distribution under climate change more
than in a constant climate scenario. Our approach yields relevant
information at different spatial scales, from plot-level processes to
large-scale abundance patterns. With it, we clearly indicate the strong
role that climate change could have in shaping future forest communities
through its differential influence on demographic processes.},

abstract = {Foundational to trait-based community ecology is the expectation that functional traits determine demographic outcomes. However, trait–demographic rate relationships are frequently weak, particularly in tree communities. The foundation of trait-based tree community ecology may, therefore, appear to be unstable. Here we argue that there are three core reasons why trait–demographic relationships are generally weak in tree communities. Specifically, important contextual information is frequently ignored, there is too much focus on species relative to individuals, and there are dimensions of tree function that are critical for determining tree demographic rates that are not captured by easily measured functional traits. Rather than being evidence that trait-based community ecology is fundamentally flawed, these issues elucidate a pathway towards a more robust research program.},

abstract = {In the near future, forest tree species growing in eastern Canada are expected to be affected by climate change due to an increase of human-induced greenhouse gas emissions. In this study, models were developed to estimate the impact of climate change on growth in white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss). Data were collected in a genecological test, replicated in three locations, and involving 45 distinct geographical seed sources, most of them represented by five open-pollinated families. Transfer models predicting the performance of seed sources were developed, based on temperature and precipitation differentials between the geographical origin of seed sources and the experimental site locations. These models were validated using data collected in a second genecological test series. We found that white spruce populations located within the sampled area were optimally adapted to their local environment for thermal conditions but not for moisture conditions; populations that originated from sites receiving more precipitation generally showed higher tree growth than the local sources. We predict that the adaptive lag currently related to precipitation will increase under global warming conditions. Simulations of growth under various scenarios of climate change indicated that it would be diminished tangibly under more intense warming. However, for a given temperature increase, the relative loss in growth will be less if precipitation is reduced than if it increases. Consequently, predictions based solely on temperature change appear inaccurate, and more effort should be directed toward better anticipating the magnitude and the direction of changes in precipitation patterns at the regional scale. The necessity of human intervention to assist tree migration under climate change is examined. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Forest restoration programmes aim to use material for re-planting that is genetically diverse and not inbred. However, restricted seed sampling, high variance in reproductive output, and the production of inbred seeds that survive in the nursery but not in the wild can lead to forest restoration stock being genetically compromised. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the reproductive biology of the New Caledonian endemic conifer Araucaria nemorosa makes it susceptible to these genetic problems and to assess whether there is evidence for genetic bottlenecks and elevated inbreeding in nursery stock compared to seedlings and adults from wild source populations. Reproductive output was low with high variance among trees (only 14{\%} of adult trees surveyed produced mature cones, {\textgreater}50{\%} of examined cones had {\textless}10 viable seeds). Evidence for an extreme genetic bottleneck was detected in a nursery population established from cones collected from adult trees. A second nursery population established with seed collected from the forest floor showed no evidence of a genetic bottleneck, but was inbred compared to its wild source population. In light of these results, we do not recommend collecting cones directly from A. nemorosa as an efficient means of establishing genetically diverse stock for restoration programmes. Collecting seed from the forest floor is likely to be more effective, but the planting stock may contain a high proportion of inbred individuals. Collecting established wild seedlings already subjected to natural selection is suggested as an alternative method of maximising the diversity captured, whilst minimising sampling effort and proportion of inbred individuals. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Herbarium accession data offer a useful historical botanical perspective and have been used to track the spread of plant invasions through time and space. Nevertheless, few studies have utilised this resource for genetic analysis to reconstruct a more complete picture of historical invasion dynamics, including the occurrence of separate introduction events. In this study, we combined nuclear and chloroplast microsatellite analyses of contemporary and historical collections of Senecio madagascariensis, a globally invasive weed first introduced to Australia c. 1918 from its native South Africa. Analysis of nuclear microsatellites, together with temporal spread data and simulations of herbarium voucher sampling, revealed distinct introductions to south-eastern Australia and mid-eastern Australia. Genetic diversity of the south-eastern invasive population was lower than in the native range, but higher than in the mid-eastern invasion. In the invasive range, despite its low resolution, our chloroplast microsatellite data revealed the occurrence of new haplotypes over time, probably as the result of subsequent introduction(s) to Australia from the native range during the latter half of the 20th century. Our work demonstrates how molecular studies of contemporary and historical field collections can be combined to reconstruct a more complete picture of the invasion history of introduced taxa. Further, our study indicates that a survey of contemporary samples only (as undertaken for the majority of invasive species studies) would be insufficient to identify potential source populations and occurrence of multiple introductions.},

abstract = {Predicting which species will occur together in the future, and where, remains one of the greatest challenges in ecology, and requires a sound understanding of how the abiotic and biotic environments interact with dispersal processes and history across scales. Biotic interactions and their dynamics influence species' relationships to climate, and this also has important implications for predicting future distributions of species. It is already well accepted that biotic interactions shape species' spatial distributions at local spatial extents, but the role of these interactions beyond local extents (e.g. 10 km(2) to global extents) are usually dismissed as unimportant. In this review we consolidate evidence for how biotic interactions shape species distributions beyond local extents and review methods for integrating biotic interactions into species distribution modelling tools. Drawing upon evidence from contemporary and palaeoecological studies of individual species ranges, functional groups, and species richness patterns, we show that biotic interactions have clearly left their mark on species distributions and realised assemblages of species across all spatial extents. We demonstrate this with examples from within and across trophic groups. A range of species distribution modelling tools is available to quantify species environmental relationships and predict species occurrence, such as: (i) integrating pairwise dependencies, (ii) using integrative predictors, and (iii) hybridising species distribution models (SDMs) with dynamic models. These methods have typically only been applied to interacting pairs of species at a single time, require a priori ecological knowledge about which species interact, and due to data paucity must assume that biotic interactions are constant in space and time. To better inform the future development of these models across spatial scales, we call for accelerated collection of spatially and temporally explicit species data. Ideally, these data should be sampled to reflect variation in the underlying environment across large spatial extents, and at fine spatial resolution. Simplified ecosystems where there are relatively few interacting species and sometimes a wealth of existing ecosystem monitoring data (e.g. arctic, alpine or island habitats) offer settings where the development of modelling tools that account for biotic interactions may be less difficult than elsewhere.},

However, local adaptation and biotic interactions also influence range limits and thus may impact range shifts. Despite the potential importance of these factors, few studies have directly tested their effects on perfor- mance at range limits. We address how population-level variation and biotic interactions may affect range shifts by transplanting seeds and seedlings of western North American conifers of different origin populations into different competitive neighborhoods within and beyond their elevational ranges and monitoring their performance. We find evidence that competition with neighboring trees limits performance within current ranges, but that interactions between adults and juveniles switch from competitive to facilitative at upper range limits. Local adaptation had weaker effects on performance that did not predictably vary with range position or seed origin. Our findings suggest that competitive interactions may slow species turnover within forests at lower range limits, whereas facilitative interactions may accelerate the pace of tree expansions upward near timberline.},

Our objective in this study was to experimentally determine the effect of high and low disturbance regimes, frequency and intensity combined, on marine benthic alpha and beta diversity. The experiment was conducted in a rock pool system of the St. Lawrence estuary, Canada. Rock pools were disturbed by (1) nutrient enrichment and (2) draining according to three disturbance regimes (none, low, high). Disturbance regimes had little or no effect on alpha diversity of benthic algae and sessile animals. However, the low regime of nutrient enrichment induced greater within-group beta diversity than the reference rock pools, while the high disturbance regime induced equal or even smaller within-group beta diversity compared to the reference. Draining had an opposite effect on benthic beta diversity, with a greater variability of the community structure under the high regime of disturbance. Taking into account the effect of disturbance regimes on beta diversity could provide a useful diagnostic for disturbed benthic communities.},

abstract = {Although theory has demonstrated rather low levels of gene flow are sufficient to counteract opposing mutation, drift, and selection, widespread recognition of the evolutionary importance of gene flow has come slowly. The perceived role of gene flow as an evolutionary force has vacillated over the last century. In the last few decades, new methods and analyses have demonstrated that plant gene flow rates vary tremendously-from nil to very high-depending on the species and specific populations involved, and sometimes over time for individual populations. In many cases, the measured gene flow rates are evolutionarily significant at distances of hundreds and sometimes thousands of meters, occurring at levels sufficient to counteract drift, spread advantageous alleles, or thwart moderate levels of opposing local selection. Gene flow in plants is likely to often act as a cohesive force, uniting individual plant species into real evolutionary units. Also, gene flow can evolve under natural selection, decreasing or increasing. The fact of frequent, but variable, plant gene flow has important consequences for applied issues in which the presence or absence of gene flow might influence the outcome of a policy, regulatory, or management decision. Examples include the unintended spread of engineered genes, the evolution of invasiveness, and conservation. New data-rich genomic techniques allow closer scrutiny of the role of gene flow in plant evolution. Most plant evolutionists now recognize the importance of gene flow, and it is receiving increased recognition from other areas of plant biology as well.},

Mill.) and spruce (Picea spp.) stands in New Brunswick, Canada, to determine the extent of tree-to-tree interactions and their effect on individual-tree mortality and stand break-up. Fifty circular 11.3 m radius permanent sample plots, established from 1987 to 1989 and remeasured every 3-5 years, were stem-mapped for tree and dead wood data in 2003-2005. Data included 1332 live trees and 1160 dead trees. Tree-to-tree interactions were assessed for trees within a 5 m circle of all subject trees in 12 m ?? 12 m subplots. Logistic regression models of individual-tree mortality were generated for two analysis periods, corresponding to about the end of a spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana (Clem.)) outbreak (1990-1992) and about 10 years after the cessation of budworm defoliation (1999-2003). From 1990-1992, significant predictor variables included annual diameter increment, moderate-severe spruce budworm defoliation, and stem defects. The mortality model also includes a distance-dependent competition index that outperformed all other measures of competition. By 1999-2003, annual diameter growth had increased by 30{\%} following cessation of defoliation. Predictors of individual-tree mortality of trees alive in 1999-2003 included stem defects and annual wind-related mortality of neighbouring trees. Wind damage was the primary cause of death, and increased as canopies became more open. Treefall events occurred mostly in the winter, as indicated by alignment of easterly treefall direction with winter prevailing winds. Dead treefall collisions accounted for 1.1{\%} of tree deaths and damaged 1.3{\%} of live trees. Mortality model results suggest that when stands reach a critical stage of decline, probability of mortality for residual trees is dramatically increased due to absence of protection from neighbouring trees and increased wind exposure, effecting rapid stand break-up. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Multivariate analyses of variance with permutation tests were performed to compare stand types in relation to species composition and reproductive traits. Native forests presented higher stem density when compared to the plantations, while species richness did not vary among stand types. Species composition differed between the native forest and the plantations. Species' reproductive traits differed between the two types of plantations. The higher frequency of zoochorous diaspores in P. elliottii plantations when compared to the other stand types suggests the importance of the fauna in creating and sustaining the understory structure in this type of plantation. Plantations show a high potential as colonization sites by native woody species, despite their structural differences in relation to native forests. If properly managed, plantations might be catalysts for the recovery of degraded areas. {\textcopyright} 2014 Associa{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o Brasileira de Ci{\^{e}}ncia Ecol{\'{o}}gica e Conserva{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o.

abstract = {A spatial and mechanistic model is developed for the dynamics of transition$\backslash$noak-northern hardwoods forests in northeastern North America. The$\backslash$npurpose of the model is to extrapolate from measurable fine-scale$\backslash$nand short-term interactions among individual trees to large-scale$\backslash$nand long-term dynamics of forest communities. Field methods, statistical$\backslash$nestimators, and model structure were designed simultaneously to ensure$\backslash$nthat parameters could be estimated from data collected in the field.$\backslash$nThis paper documents eight aspects of a three-year study to calibrate,$\backslash$ntest, and analyze the model for the nine dominant and subdominant$\backslash$ntree species in transition oak-northern hardwoods forests: 1) Design$\backslash$nand structure of the model. The model makes population dynamic forecasts$\backslash$nby predicting the fate of every individual tree throughout its life.$\backslash$nSpecies-specific functions predict each tree's dispersal, establishment,$\backslash$ngrowth, mortality, and fecundity. Trees occupy unique spatial positions,$\backslash$nand individual performance is affected by the local availability$\backslash$nof resources. Competition is mechanistic; resources available to$\backslash$neach tree are reduced by neighbors. Although the model was developed$\backslash$nto include light, water, and nitrogen, the version described here$\backslash$nincludes only competition for light (shading and light-dependent$\backslash$nperformance) because the field data provide little evidence of competition$\backslash$nfor nitrogen and water over the range of sites examined. 2) Estimates$\backslash$nof the model's parameters for each species. The estimates reveal$\backslash$na variety of "strategic trade-offs" among the species. For example,$\backslash$nspecies that grow quickly under high light tend to cast relatively$\backslash$nlittle shade, have low survivorship under low light, and have high$\backslash$ndispersal. In contrast, species that grow slowly under high light$\backslash$ntend to cast relatively dark shade, and to have high survivorship$\backslash$nunder low light and low dispersal. These trade-offs define one of$\backslash$ntwo dominant "axes" of strategic variation. 3) Community level predictions$\backslash$nof the model. The model predicts succession from early dominance$\backslash$nby species such as Quercus rubra and Prunus serotina, to late dominance$\backslash$nby Fagus grandifolia and Tsuga canadensis, with Betula alleganiensis$\backslash$npresent as a gap phase species in old-growth stands. The model also$\backslash$npredicts that old-growth communities will have intraspecifically$\backslash$nclumped and interspecifically segregated spatial distributions. 4)$\backslash$nAn error analysis that identifies community level predictions that$\backslash$nare robust given the level of sampling uncertainty in the study.$\backslash$nThis analysis translates the statistical uncertainty associated with$\backslash$neach parameter estimate into statistical uncertainty in the model's$\backslash$npredictions. The robust predictions include those mentioned in aspect$\backslash$n(3) above. 5) Sensitivity of the model to changes in initial conditions$\backslash$nand to changes in the three parameters not included in the error$\backslash$nanalysis. For example, the model predicts that initial abundances$\backslash$ncontinue to affect community composition well into succession ({\textgreater}$\backslash$n300 yr for some species). 6) Tests of the system- and community-level$\backslash$npredictions of the model against independent data gleaned from other$\backslash$nstudies. These tests support the predictions found to be robust in$\backslash$nthe error analysis, including those predictions mentioned in aspect$\backslash$n(3) above. 7) Modeling experiments that determine which aspects of$\backslash$nindividual performance and inter-neighbor competition are responsible$\backslash$nfor each of the robust predictions identified in aspect (4) above$\backslash$nand tested in aspect (6) above. This analysis reveals a wide variety$\backslash$nof causal relationships, with most parameters contributing to at$\backslash$nleast one community level phenomenon. 8) An explanation of the diversity$\backslash$nof individual level causes identified in aspect (7). The two "axes"$\backslash$ndescribing most of the strategic variation among the species (see$\backslash$n[2]), provide a simple explanation of community level pattern in$\backslash$nterms of individual level processes.},

abstract = {The phylogeographical history of mid-altitude woodland herbs that depend on moist and shaded forest habitats is poorly understood. Here, we analysed the genetic structure of Cyclamen purpurascens, a mountainous calcicolous perennial, to test hypotheses regarding its glacial survival in single or multiple refugia and postglacial colonization routes, and to explore how they are congruent with the histories inferred for temperate trees and other mountainous herbs. We gathered AFLP data and chloroplast DNA sequences (trnD-trnT region) from 68 populations spanning the entire distribution range (the Jura Mountains, Alps, western Carpathians, Dinarides). Both genetic markers revealed two main phylogeographical groups (phylogroups) in C.purpurascens. Additionally, AFLP data detected a more detailed structure of five phylogroups: two widespread, showing east-west geographical separation, and three local ones, restricted to somewhat disjunct, marginal regions of the species range. We suggest that C.purpurascens survived the last glaciation in two main regions, the foothills of the Southern Limestone Alps and the Karst area of the north-western Dinarides, and possibly also in microrefugia in the Western Carpathians. The glacial persistence and colonization routes of this woodland herb are highly concordant with those inferred for several temperate trees, especially the European beech. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Linnean Society of London.},

abstract = {Functional traits are important drivers of successional processes and the assembly of plant communities. It is generally assumed that functional traits are closely linked to the regeneration niche because of the high selection pressures in the seedling stage, but recent studies have challenged this view. In this study, I use cross species and phylogenetic correlation analysis between leaf traits and light environment to evaluate whether species are adapted to the regeneration niche, adult niche, or both. Leaf chemistry, morphology, physiology, and crown exposure were quantified for up to 58 Bolivian tropical moist forest tree species that differ in their regeneration and adult light niche. Multiple regression analysis shows that leaf traits of seedlings, saplings, and trees are most strongly related to the regeneration niche, and once this is taken into account, adult niche does not significantly explain any of the remaining variation in leaf traits. This suggests that, although the regeneration phase is short, it has a long-lasting effect on the form and shape of plant species.},

abstract = {The early genetic effects of habitat degradation were investigated in the critically endangered conifer Araucaria nemorosa. This species occurs in New Caledonia, a global biodiversity hotspot where the world's greatest concentration of endemic conifer species coincides with an extremely high level of habitat destruction due to fire and mining. Using seven microsatellite loci, estimates were made of genetic marker variation, inbreeding coefficients and population differentiation of adult and seedling cohorts of A. nemorosa. These were contrasted with equivalent estimates, made over similar spatial scales and with the same marker loci, in the locally common and more widespread sister species Araucaria columnaris. There were no significant differences in population genetic parameters between adult populations of the two species, despite their different abundances. However, in A. nemorosa, the juvenile cohort showed a loss of rare alleles and elevated levels of inbreeding when compared to the adult cohort. These genetic differences between the cohorts were not observed in the locally common A. columnaris. This suggests that recent environmental degradation is influencing the genetic structure of A. nemorosa populations. Although this is not detectable among predisturbance adult populations, an early warning of these impacts is evident in more recently established seedling cohorts. The conservation implications of these results are discussed.},

The validity of model projections, such as shifts in a species' climatic niche, becomes questionable particularly during extrapolations, such as for future no-analog climate conditions. To examine the effects of model complexity on SDM predictive performance, we fit statistical models of varying complexity to simulated species occurrence data arising from data-generating processes that assume differing degrees of distributional symmetry in environmental space, interaction effects, and coverage in climate space. Mismatches between data-generating processes and statistical models (i.e., different functional forms) led to poor predictive performance when extrapolating to new climate-space and greater variation in extrapolated predictions for overly complex models. In contrast, performance issues were not apparent when using independent evaluation data from the training region. These results draw into question the use of highly flexible models for prediction without ecological justification.},

abstract = {Dispersal is critical step in plant invasions but there is limited information about human-mediated long distance seed dispersal, including in protected areas. Seed dispersal by hikers was quantified for five invasive species (the native Acaena novae-zelandiae, and the non-native weeds Rumex acetosella Anthoxanthum odoratum, Dactylis glomerata and Festuca rubra) in part of Australia's Kosciuszko National Park. The proportion of seeds remaining attached to trousers and socks was quantified for replicated short (150 m) and long (5,000 m) distance walks. Functions were fitted for each dataset, and parameters compared among species and between trousers and socks. Dispersal data were combined with attachment rates and the number of people undertaking walks to estimate the total number of weed seeds that might be dispersed. The power exponential function gave the best fit for the majority of datasets, indicating that detachment probability decreased with distance. Seeds of all five species were more tightly attached to socks than trousers, with some seeds still present on socks at 5,000 m. Anthoxanthum and Acaena seeds were more tightly attached to clothing than the other species. Theoretically 1.9 million seeds could be dispersed on socks or 2.4 million seeds on trousers through a season but the actual numbers are likely to be much lower because of limited weed seed at the start of the walks. Because of differences in attachment and detachment rates, seeds from Acaena were more likely to be dispersed longer distances. Long distance human-mediated seed dispersal is potentially a major cause of spread of invasive weeds into protected areas that favours some invasive species over others.},

Failure to incorporate these interactions limits the ability to predict responses of species to climate change.

We investigated 13 covariates in four categories: climate, air pollutants, topography, and stand characteristics. Overall, we found that tree mortality was most sensitive to stand characteristics and air pollutants. Different functional groups also varied considerably in their sensitivity to environmental drivers.

Depending on climatic impacts on other life stages and on interacting species, however, the results from simple experiments may not translate into accurate predictions of future ecological change. Research needs to move beyond simple experimental studies and environmental envelope projections for single species towards identifying where ecosystem change is likely to occur and the drivers for this change. For this to happen, we advocate research directions that (i) identify the critical species within the target ecosystem, and the life stage(s) most susceptible to changing conditions and (ii) the key interactions between these species and components of their broader ecosystem. A combined approach using macroecology, experimentally derived data and modelling that incorporates energy budgets in life cycle models may identify critical abiotic conditions that disproportionately alter important ecological processes under forecasted climates. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Royal Society.},

abstract = {The steady upward trend in the use of model selection and Bayesian methods in ecological research has made it clear that both approaches to inference are important for modern analysis of models and data. However, in teaching Bayesian methods and in working with our research colleagues, we have noticed a general dissatisfaction with the available literature on Bayesian model selection and multimodel inference. Students and researchers new to Bayesian methods quickly find that the published advice on model selection is often preferential in its treatment of options for analysis, frequently advocating one particular method above others. The recent appearance of many articles and textbooks on Bayesian modeling has provided welcome background on relevant approaches to model selection in the Bayesian framework, but most of these are either very narrowly focused in scope or inaccessible to ecologists. Moreover, the methodological details of Bayesian model selection approaches are spread thinly throughout the literature, appearing in journals from many different fields. Our aim with this guide is to condense the large body of literature on Bayesian approaches to model selection and multimodel inference and present it specifically for quantitative ecologists as neutrally as possible. We also bring to light a few important and fundamental concepts relating directly to model selection that seem to have gone unnoticed in the ecological literature. Throughout, we provide only a minimal discussion of philosophy, preferring instead to examine the breadth of approaches as well as their practical advantages and disadvantages. This guide serves as a reference for ecologists using Bayesian methods, so that they can better understand their options and can make an informed choice that is best aligned with their goals for inference.},

abstract = {Aspects of the tree mortality regime were characterized for old-growth conifer forests in Mount Rainier National Park, Washington, USA, using individual tree (stems ≥5 cm diameter at breast height (dbh)) records from a network of permanent forest research plots. Average annual forest-wide mortality rates of trees ≥15 cm dbh never exceeded 1{\%} on a stem-density or basal-area basis; mortality was slightly higher for stems {\textless} 15 cm dbh. Physical agents of mortality (uprooting, stem breakage, and crushing by falling debris) accounted for approximately 40{\%} and 45{\%} of mortality events in trees {\textless} 15 and ≥15 cm dbh, respectively. These physical processes were chronic sources of mortality: they were not associated with a single or few disturbance events. Preexisting decay fungi were associated with trees that died proximately due to stem breakage (41{\%}) and uprooting (22{\%}), consistent with a predisposing role of decay fungi in trees that die due to mechanical damage. Given the importance of physical processes in the tree mortality regime, we suggest that a richer mechanistic understanding of the causes and consequences of tree mortality in natural forests will be achieved with models that consider the physical, as well as the physiological, attributes of trees and forests.},

Those positive diversity effects resulted mostly from selection effects, primarily driven by fast-growing deciduous species and associated traits.

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Preserving large tracts of natural habitats is essential to maintain biodiversity. Nevertheless, even large areas may still suffer from less "visible" impacts such as loss of ecological processes. Because mapping ecological processes over large scales is not practical, an alternative is to map surrogate species that are key for those processes. In this study, we chose four species of Neotropical large mammals (the largest apex predator: jaguar - Panthera onca; the largest herbivore: tapir - Tapirus terrestris; the largest seed predator: white-lipped peccary - Tayassu pecari; and the largest arboreal seed disperser: muriqui - Brachyteles spp.) in an ecosystem with an old history of human impact (the Atlantic Forest) to test whether areas with native forest still harbor ecological processes that may guarantee long-term ecosystem maintenance. We gathered 94 locations with recent presence of the four species to map current ranges and model suitable areas. Our results reveal that 96{\%} of the remaining Atlantic Forest is depleted of at least one of the four surrogate species and 88{\%} is completely depleted of all four surrogate species. We also found that only 16{\%} is still environmentally suitable for all four, and 55{\%} is completely unsuitable to all four of them. Our study highlights the importance of looking beyond land cover to fully depict intactness of natural areas, and suggests that ecosystems with a long history of human impact (such as the Atlantic Forest) may be suffering from ecological impacts not seen at a first glance. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Many invasive species are too widespread to realistically eradicate. For such species, a viable management strategy is to slow the rate of spread. However, to be effective, this will require detailed spread data and an understanding of the influence of environmental conditions and landscape structure on invasion rates. We used a time series of remotely sensed distribution maps and a spatial simulation model to study spread of the invasive Lepidium latifolium (perennial pepperweed) in California's Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta. L. latifolium is a noxious weed and exhibited rapid, explosive spread. Annual infested area and empirical dispersal kernels were derived from the remotely sensed distributions in order to assess the influence of weather conditions on spread and to parameterize the simulation model. Spread rates and dispersal distances were highest for nascent infestations and in years with wet springs. Simulations revealed that spread rates were more strongly influenced by the length of long-distance dispersal than by temporal variation in its likelihood. It is thus important to capture long-distance dispersal and the conditions that facilitate spread when collecting data to parameterize spread models. Additionally, management actions performed in high-spread years, targeting long-distance recruits, can effectively contain infestations. Corridors were relatively unimportant to spread rates; their effectiveness at enhancing rate of spread was limited by the species' dispersal ability and the time needed to travel through the corridor. In contrast, habitat abundance and shape surrounding the introduction site strongly influenced invasion dynamics. Satellite patches invading large areas of invasible habitat present especially high risk.},

abstract = {Ongoing climate change is expected to shift tree species distribution and therefore affect forest biodiversity and ecosystem services. To assess and project tree distributional shifts, researchers may compare the distribution of juvenile and adult trees under the assumption that differences between tree life-stages reflect distributional shifts triggered by climate change. However, the distribution of tree life-stages could differ within the lifespan of trees, therefore we hypothesize that currently observed distributional differences could represent shifts over ontogeny as opposed to climatically driven changes. Here we test this hypothesis with data from 1435 plots resurveyed after more than three decades across the Western Carpathians. We compared seedling, sapling and adult distribution of 12 tree species along elevation, temperature and precipitation gradients. We analyzed i) temporal shifts between the surveys and ii) distributional differences between tree life-stages within both surveys. Despite climate warming, tree species distribution of any life-stage did not shift directionally upward along elevation between the surveys. Temporal elevational shifts were species-specific and an order of magnitude lower than differences among tree life-stages within the surveys. Our results show that the observed range shifts among tree life-stages are more consistent with ontogenetic differences in the species' environmental requirements than with responses to recent climate change. The distribution of seedlings substantially differed from saplings and adults, while the distribution of saplings did not differ from adults, indicating a critical transition between seedling and sapling tree life-stages. Future research has to take ontogenetic differences among life-stages into account as we found that distributional differences recently observed worldwide may not reflect climate change but rather the different environmental requirements of tree life-stages.},

Stochastic variation in structured population models influences estimates of population growth rate, persistence and resilience, which ultimately can alter community composition, species interactions, distributions and harvesting. Here, we discuss how understanding these demographic consequences of environmental variation will have applications for anticipating changes in populations resulting from anthropogenic activities that affect the variance in vital rates.

abstract = {Knowledge of species' geographic distributions is critical for understanding and forecasting population dynamics, responses to environmental change, biodiversity patterns, and conservation planning. While many suggestive correlative occurrence models have been used to these ends, progress lies in understanding the underlying population biology that generates patterns of range dynamics. Here, we show how to use a limited quantity of demographic data to produce demographic distribution models (DDMs) using integral projection models for size-structured populations. By modeling survival, growth, and fecundity using regression, integral projection models can interpolate across missing size data and environmental conditions to compensate for limited data. To accommodate the uncertainty associated with limited data and model assumptions, we use Bayesian models to propagate uncertainty through all stages of model development to predictions. DDMs have a number of strengths: 1) DDMs allow a mechanistic understanding of spatial occurrence patterns; 2) DDMs can predict spatial and temporal variation in local population dynamics; 3) DDMs can facilitate extrapolation under altered environmental conditions because one can evaluate the consequences for individual vital rates. To illustrate these features, we construct DDMs for an overstory perennial shrub in the Proteaceae family in the Cape Floristic Region of South Africa. We find that the species' population growth rate is limited most strongly by adult survival throughout the range and by individual growth in higher rainfall regions. While the models predict higher population growth rates in the core of the range under projected climates for 2050, they also suggest that the species faces a threat along arid range margins from the interaction of more frequent fire and drying climate. The results (and uncertainties) are helpful for prioritizing additional sampling of particular demographic parameters along these gradients to iteratively refine projections. In the appendices, we provide fully functional R code to perform all analyses.},

abstract = {Despite their narrow distribution, Australian rainforests still contain considerable levels of diversity and include many ancient, but often rare, lineages. Very little is known about the general biology of rainforest species, yet their long-term management depends on a better understanding of the main factors leading to rarity. For instance, are they highly endemic taxa, at the early stages of expansion, nearing the end of a period of decline, or persisting at low numbers over the long term? In this study we combine molecular, environmental, and ecological data to identify the factors responsible for the narrow distribution of a paleoendemic rainforest tree: Elaeocarpus sedentarius (Elaeocarpaceae). Between-population and between-generation comparisons of genetic diversity across all known populations of E. sedentarius show evidence of mutation-drift equilibrium rather than evidence of a recent bottleneck. Similarly, floristic and environmental data negate the hypothesis of rarity as a consequence of highly specialized habitat requirements. Instead, genetic structure and the available ecological data support the hypothesis of dispersal limitation as the main cause of endemism and that the species may have attained genetic equilibrium without realizing its full niche potential. We suggest that these factors are likely to explain narrow endemism in a broader range of taxa.},

abstract = {A change in a climate variable may alter a species' abundance not only through a direct effect on that species' vital rates, but also through 'indirect' effects mediated by species interactions. While recent work has highlighted cases in which indirect effects overwhelm the direct effects of climate, we lack robust generalizations to predict the strength of indirect effects. For communities dominated by non-trophic interactions, we propose that the potential for indirect effects of climate change declines with the strength of stabilizing niche differences. We tested this hypothesis by analysing an empirically parameterized four species population model. We quantified negative frequency dependence in population growth rates as a measure of stabilizing niche differences and projected the sensitivity of each species to direct and indirect effects of climate perturbations. Consistent with our hypothesis, species' sensitivities to indirect effects decreased rapidly with increasing stabilization by niche differences. Synthesis. Information about niche differences can identify species sensitive to indirect effects of climate change and determine when multispecies forecasting approaches are necessary. However, practical application of this generalization will require methods to predict niche differences from easily collected data. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Authors.

abstract = {We hypothesize that reductions in stand density through thinning improve the recovery of radial stem growth in Norway spruce trees (Picea abies) from severe drought. However, thinning may not lead to higher relative radial growth during drought. Annual stem growth and stable carbon and oxygen isotopes in early- and latewood were assessed in trees from heavily thinned (HT), moderately thinned (MT) and un-thinned control stands at two sites in southern Germany. Physiological performance of trees as inferred from stable isotope analysis was used to interpret annual stem growth in response to the drought events in 1976 and 2003. Only in recently thinned stands, trees maintained growth probably through higher soil water availability during the drought year when compared to controls. In contrast, thinning improved the growth recovery in the years following the drought irrespective of the time span between thinning and drought. We conclude that thinning improves drought recovery response in the short and long term and should be considered as an effective management strategy to increase drought tolerance of Norway spruce stands.

abstract = {The last 6000 years are of particular interest to the understanding of the Earth System because the boundary conditions of the climate system did not change dramatically (in comparison to larger glacial-interglacial changes), and because abundant, detailed regional palaeoclimatic proxy records cover this period. We use selected proxy-based reconstructions of different climate variables, together with state-of-the-art time series of natural forcings (orbital variations, solar activity variations, large tropical volcanic eruptions, land cover and greenhouse gases), underpinned by results from General Circulation Models (GCMs) and Earth System Models of Intermediate Complexity (EMICs), to establish a comprehensive explanatory framework for climate changes from the Mid-Holocene (MH) to pre-industrial time. The redistribution of solar energy, due to orbital forcing on a millennial timescale, was the cause of a progressive southward shift of the Northern Hemisphere (NH) summer position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). This was accompanied by a pronounced weakening of the monsoon systems in Africa and Asia and increasing dryness and desertification on both continents. The associated summertime cooling of the NH, combined with changing temperature gradients in the world oceans, likely led to an increasing amplitude of the El Ni{\~{n}}o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and, possibly, increasingly negative North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) indices up to the beginning of the last millennium. On decadal to multi-century timescales, a worldwide coincidence between solar irradiance minima, tropical volcanic eruptions and decadal to multi-century scale cooling events was not found. However, reconstructions show that widespread decadal to multi-century scale cooling events, accompanied by advances of mountain glaciers, occurred in the NH (e.g., in Scandinavia and the European Alps). This occurred namely during the Little Ice Age (LIA) between AD ∼1350 and 1850, when the lower summer insolation in the NH, due to orbital forcing, coincided with solar activity minima and several strong tropical volcanic eruptions. The role of orbital forcing in the NH cooling, the southward ITCZ shift and the desertification of the Sahara are supported by numerous model simulations. Other simulations have suggested that the fingerprint of solar activity variations should be strongest in the tropics, but there is also evidence that changes in the ocean heat transport took place during the LIA at high northern latitudes, with possible additional implications for climates of the Southern Hemisphere (SH). {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Recent comprehensive data provided through the DAISIE project (www.europe-aliens.org) have facilitated the development of the first pan-European assessment of the impacts of alien plants, vertebrates, and invertebrates in terrestrial, freshwater, and marine environments - on ecosystem services. There are 1094 species with documented ecological impacts and 1347 with economic impacts. The two taxonomic groups with the most species causing impacts are terrestrial invertebrates and terrestrial plants. The North Sea is the maritime region that suffers the most impacts. Across taxa and regions, ecological and economic impacts are highly correlated. Terrestrial invertebrates create greater economic impacts than ecological impacts, while the reverse is true for terrestrial plants. Alien species from all taxonomie groups affect "supporting", "provisioning", "regulating", and "cultural" services and interfere with human well-being. Terrestrial vertebrates are responsible for the greatest range of impacts, and these are widely distributed across Europe. Here, we present a review of the financial costs, as the first step toward calculating an estimate of the economic consequences of alien species in Europe. {\textcopyright} The Ecological Society of America.},

abstract = {Drought-induced, regional-scale dieback of forests has emerged as a global concern that is expected to escalate under model projections of climate change. Since 2000, drought of unusual severity, extent, and duration has affected large areas of western North America, leading to regional-scale dieback of forests in the southwestern US. We report on drought impacts on forests in a region farther north, encompassing the transition between boreal forest and prairie in western Canada. A central question is the significance of drought as an agent of large-scale tree mortality and its potential future impact on carbon cycling in this cold region. We used a combination of plot-based, meteorological, and remote sensing measures to map and quantify aboveground, dead biomass of trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) across an 11.5Mha survey area where drought was exceptionally severe during 2001-2002. Within this area, a satellite-based land cover map showed that aspen-dominated broadleaf forests occupied 2.3Mha. Aerial surveys revealed extensive patches of severe mortality ({\textgreater}55{\%}) resembling the impacts of fire. Dead aboveground biomass was estimated at 45Mt, representing 20{\%} of the total aboveground biomass, based on a spatial interpolation of plot-based measurements. Spatial variation in percentage dead biomass showed a moderately strong correlation with drought severity. In the prairie-like, southern half of the study area where the drought was most severe, 35{\%} of aspen biomass was dead, compared with an estimated 7{\%} dead biomass in the absence of drought. Drought led to an estimated 29Mt increase in dead biomass across the survey area, corresponding to 14Mt of potential future carbon emissions following decomposition. Many recent, comparable episodes of drought-induced forest dieback have been reported from around the world, which points to an emerging need for multiscale monitoring approaches to quantify drought effects on woody biomass and carbon cycling across large areas. {\textcopyright} 2010 Crown in the right of Canada.},

abstract = {Conifers are among the most genetically diverse plants but show the lowest levels of genetic differentiation, even among geographically distant populations. High gene flow among populations may be one of the most important factors in maintaining these genetic patterns. Here, we provide empirical evidence for extensive pollen-mediated gene dispersal between natural stands of a widespread northern temperate/boreal conifer, Picea glauca. We used 6 polymorphic allozyme loci to quantify the proportion of seeds sired by pollen originating from different sources in a landscape fragmented by agriculture in North Central Ontario, Canada. In 7 stands, a small proportion of seeds were sired by self-pollen or neighboring trees but 87.1{\%} (±1.7{\%} standard error [SE]) of seeds were sired by pollen from at least 250 to 3000 m away. In 4 single isolated trees, self-fertilization rates were low and more than 96{\%} (±1.3{\%} SE) of seeds were sired by immigrant pollen. The average minimum pollen dispersal distance in outcrossed matings was 619 m. These results provide strong evidence that extensive long-distance pollen dispersal plays a primary role in maintaining low genetic differentiation among natural populations of P. glauca and helps maintain genetic diversity and minimize inbreeding in small stands in a fragmented landscape.

abstract = {The ecological niche of a species describes the variation in population growth rates along environmental gradients that drives geographic range dynamics. Niches are thus central for understanding and forecasting species' geographic distributions. However, theory predicts that migration limitation, source–sink dynamics, and time-lagged local extinction can cause mismatches between niches and geographic distributions. It is still unclear how relevant these niche–distribution mismatches are for biodiversity dynamics and how they depend on species life-history traits. This is mainly due to a lack of the comprehensive, range-wide demographic data needed to directly infer ecological niches for multiple species. Here we quantify niches from extensive demographic measurements along environmental gradients across the geographic ranges of 26 plant species (Proteaceae; South Africa). We then test whether life history explains variation in species' niches and niche–distribution mismatches. Niches are generally wider for species with high seed dispersal or persistence abilities. Life-history traits also explain the considerable interspecific variation in niche–distribution mismatches: poorer dispersers are absent from larger parts of their potential geographic ranges, whereas species with higher persistence ability more frequently occupy environments outside their ecological niche. Our study thus identifies major demographic and functional determinants of species' niches and geographic distributions. It highlights that the inference of ecological niches from geographical distributions is most problematic for poorly dispersed and highly persistent species. We conclude that the direct quantification of ecological niches from demographic responses to environmental variation is a crucial step toward a better predictive understanding of biodiversity dynamics under environmental change.},

abstract = {Plant communities are often dispersal-limited and zoochory can be an efficient mechanism for plants to colonize new patches of potentially suitable habitat. We predicted that seed dispersal by ungulates acts as an ecological filter – which differentially affects individuals according to their characteristics and shapes species assemblages – and that the filter varies according to the dispersal mechanism (endozoochory, fur-epizoochory and hoof-epizoochory). We conducted two-step individual participant data meta-analyses of 52 studies on plant dispersal by ungulates in fragmented landscapes, compar- ing eight plant traits and two habitat indicators between dispersed and non-dispersed plants. We found that ungulates dispersed at least 44{\%} of the available plant species. Moreover, some plant traits and habitat indicators increased the likeli- hood for plant of being dispersed. Persistent or nitrophilous plant species from open habitats or bearing dry or elongated diaspores were more likely to be dispersed by ungulates, whatever the dispersal mechanism. In addition, endozoochory was more likely for diaspores bearing elongated appendages whereas epizoochory was more likely for diaspores released relatively high in vegetation. Hoof-epizoochory was more likely for light diaspores without hooked appendages. Fur- epizoochory was more likely for diaspores with appendages, particularly elongated or hooked ones. We thus observed a gradient of filtering effect among the three dispersal mechanisms. Endozoochory had an effect of rather weak intensity (impacting six plant characteristics with variations between ungulate-dispersed and non-dispersed plant species mostly below 25{\%}), whereas hoof-epizoochory had a stronger effect (eight characteristics included five ones with above 75{\%} varia- tion), and fur-epizoochory an even stronger one (nine characteristics included six ones with above 75{\%} variation). Our results demonstrate that seed dispersal by ungulates is an ecological filter whose intensity varies according to the dispersal mechanism considered. Ungulates can thus play a key role in plant community dynamics and have implications for plant spatial distribution patterns at multiple scales.},

abstract = {The early genetic effects of habitat degradation were investigated in the critically endangered conifer Araucaria nemorosa. This species occurs in New Caledonia, a global biodiversity hotspot where the world's greatest concentration of endemic conifer species coincides with an extremely high level of habitat destruction due to fire and mining. Using seven microsatellite loci, estimates were made of genetic marker variation, inbreeding coefficients and population differentiation of adult and seedling cohorts of A. nemorosa. These were contrasted with equivalent estimates, made over similar spatial scales and with the same marker loci, in the locally common and more widespread sister species Araucaria columnaris. There were no significant differences in population genetic parameters between adult populations of the two species, despite their different abundances. However, in A. nemorosa, the juvenile cohort showed a loss of rare alleles and elevated levels of inbreeding when compared to the adult cohort. These genetic differences between the cohorts were not observed in the locally common A. columnaris. This suggests that recent environmental degradation is influencing the genetic structure of A. nemorosa populations. Although this is not detectable among predisturbance adult populations, an early warning of these impacts is evident in more recently established seedling cohorts. The conservation implications of these results are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2007 The Authors.},

In climates predicted less favourable populations are expected to decline, and in favourable climates they are expected to persist. However, little comparative empirical support exists for a relationship between predicted climate suitability and population performance. We found that the performance of 93 populations of 34 plant species worldwide - as measured by in situ population growth rate, its temporal variation and extinction risk - was not correlated with climate suitability. However, correlations of demographic processes underpinning population performance with climate suitability indicated both resistance and vulnerability pathways of population responses to climate: in less suitable climates, plants experienced greater retrogression (resistance pathway) and greater variability in some demographic rates (vulnerability pathway). While a range of demographic strategies occur within species' climatic niches, demographic strategies are more constrained in climates predicted to be less suitable.},

abstract = {There is currently an increasing societal and political shift towards more sustainable agricultural systems to provide both food production and ecological biodiversity levels. This shift has recently modified scientific questioning and brought up new research challenges for agro-ecological research. This is the case in particular for weed management, where issues have so far largely focused on the conflict between weeds and crop productivity. Here, we review recent findings that have led to a changing perception on weeds in agro-ecosystems and upcoming areas in terms of weed management options. Our main findings are that weeds have numerous interactions with other organisms and, in turn, some of these interactions can have direct, either negative or positive, effects on the functioning of the agro-ecosystem. Many interactions are species-specific, and therefore assessing the role of weed communities in the agro-ecosystem would benefit from further development in the functional grouping of weed species. In terms of weed management our review shows that alternative cropping systems can deliver both good levels of crop productivity and of weed management at the field level. Weeds respond to landscape attributes and there is a need to fully assess the scope for utilizing the spatio-temporal organization of cropping systems and uncultivated habitats as a tool for minimizing weed infestations. Weeds are also submitted to biological regulation through the predation of their seeds and further research is required to assess the effect of cropping systems and landscape on levels of weed natural enemies, and therefore on the potential contribution of biological regulation in the management of weeds.},

However, the number of reports documenting other types of range shifts – such as in east-west directions across longitudes or, even more unexpectedly, towards tropical latitudes and lower elevations – is increasing rapidly. Recent studies show that these range shifts may not be so unexpected once the local climate changes are accounted for. We here provide an updated synthesis of the fast-moving research on climate-related range shifts. By describing the current state of the art on geographical patterns of species range shifts under contemporary climate change for plants and animals across both terrestrial and marine ecosystems, we identified a number of research shortfalls. In addition to the recognised geographic shortfall in the tropics, we found taxonomic and methodological shortfalls with knowledge gaps regarding range shifts of prokaryotes, lowland range shifts of terrestrial plants, and bathymetric range shifts of marine plants. Based on this review, we provide a research agenda for filling these gaps. We outline a comprehensive framework for assessing multidimensional changes in species distributions, which should then be contrasted with expectations based on climate change indices, such as velocity measures accounting for complex local climate changes. Finally, we propose a unified classification of geographical patterns of species range shifts, arranged in a bi-dimensional space defined by species' persistence and movement rates. Placing the observed and expected shifts into this bi-dimensional space should lead to more informed assessments of extinction risks.},

abstract = {Weed control through crop rotation has mainly been studied in a nonspatial context. However, weed seeds are often spread beyond the crop field by a variety of vectors. For weed control to be successful, weed management should thus be evaluated at the landscape level. In this paper we assess how seed dispersal affects the interactions between crop rotation and landscape heterogeneity schemes with regard to weed control. A spatially explicit landscape model was developed to study both short- and long-term weed population dynamics under different management scenarios. We allowed for both two- and three-crop species rotations and three levels of between-field weed seed dispersal. All rotation scenarios and seed dispersal fractions were analyzed for both completely homogeneous landscapes and heterogeneous landscapes in which more than one crop was present. The potential of implementing new weed control methods was also analyzed. The model results suggest that, like crop rotation at the field level, crop rotation implemented at the landscape level has great potential to control weeds, whereby both the number of crop species and the cropping sequence within the crop rotation have significant effects on both the short- and long-term weed population densities. In the absence of seed dispersal, weed populations became extinct when the fraction of each crop in the landscape was randomized. In general, weed seed densities increased in landscapes with increasing similarity in crop proportions, but in these landscapes the level of seed dispersal affected which three-crop species rotation sequence was most efficient at controlling the weed densities. We show that ignoring seed dispersal between fields might lead to the selection of suboptimal tactics and that homogeneous crop field patches that follow a specific crop rotation sequence might be the most sustainable method of weed control. Effective weed control through crop rotation thus requires coordination between farmers with regard to cropping sequences, crop allocation across the landscape, and/ or the fraction of each crop across the landscape.},

Anthropogenic perturbations alter communities, but how they change stability and the strength of stabilizing mechanisms is not clear. We examined temporal stability (invariability) in aboveground productivity in replicated 18-year time series of experimentally perturbed grassland plant communities. We found that disturbed annual-dominated communities were more stable than undisturbed perennial communities, coincident with increases in the stabilizing effect of mean-variance scaling. We also found that nitrogen-fertilized communities maintained stability despite losses in species richness, probably because of increased compensatory dynamics and increased dominance by particularly stable dominant species. Among our communities, slight variation in diversity was not the strongest mechanism driving differences in stability. Instead, our study suggests that decreases in individual species variabilities and increases in the relative abundance of stable dominant species may help maintain stability in the functioning of ecosystems confronted with eutrophication, disturbance, and other global changes.},

However, correlations of demographic processes underpinning population performance with climate suitability indicated both resistance and vulnerability pathways of population responses to climate: in less suitable climates, plants experienced greater retrogression (resistance pathway) and greater variability in some demographic rates (vulnerability pathway). While a range of demographic strategies occur within species' climatic niches, demographic strategies are more constrained in climates predicted to be less suitable.},

abstract = {Long-term environmental changes will likely alter the strengths of interactions between species and consequently their population dynamics, leading to changes in the stability of ecological systems. While an increasing number of empirical studies have shown that environmental changes can alter the strengths of species interactions, these studies are typically short ({\textless}1–2 generations) and therefore give only partial information about longer term population dynamics. To focus on longer term dynamics, we investigated population cycles of pea aphids and their most common parasitoid, Aphidius ervi, in Wisconsin, USA. Data collected over three years in alfalfa fields showed an apparent host–parasitoid population cycle. Furthermore, higher pea aphid population growth rates and increased parasitism were correlated with higher naturally occurring temperatures. While these effects were observed with seasonal fluctuations in temperature, they beg the question of how long-term changes in mean annual temperature might...},

abstract = {Matrix projection models occupy a central role in population and conservation biology. Matrix models divide a population into discrete classes, even if the structuring trait exhibits continuous variation (e.g., body size). The integral projection model (IPM) avoids discrete classes and potential artifacts from arbitrary class divisions, facilitates parsimonious modeling based on smooth relationships between individual state and demographic performance, and can be implemented with standard matrix software. Here, we extend the IPM to species with complex demographic attributes, including dormant and active life stages, cross-classification by several attributes (e.g., size, age, and condition), and changes between discrete and continuous structure over the life cycle. We present a general model encompassing these cases, numerical methods, and theoretical results, including stable population growth and sensitivity/ elasticity analysis for density-independent models, local stability analysis in density-dependent models, and optimal/evolutionarily stable strategy life-history analysis. Our presentation centers on an IPM for the thistle Onopordum illyricum based on a 6-year field study. Flowering and death probabilities are size and age dependent, and individuals also vary in a latent attribute affecting survival, but a predictively accurate IPM is completely parameterized by fitting a few regression equations.

abstract = {Premise of the study: Near-future climate changes are likely to elicit major vegetation changes. Disequilibrium dynamics, which occur when vegetation comes out of equilibrium with climate, are potentially a key facet of these. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for making accurate predictions, informing conservation planning, and understanding likely changes in ecosystem function on time scales relevant to society. However, many predictive studies have instead focused on equilibrium end-points with little consideration of the transient trajectories. Methods: We review what we should expect in terms of disequilibrium vegetation dynamics over the next 50-200 yr, covering a broad range of research fields including paleoecology, macroecology, landscape ecology, vegetation science, plant ecology, invasion biology, global change biology, and ecosystem ecology. Key results: The expected climate changes are likely to induce marked vegetation disequilibrium with climate at both leading and trailing edges, with leading-edge disequilibrium dynamics due to lags in migration at continental to landscape scales, in local population build-up and succession, in local evolutionary responses, and in ecosystem development, and trailing-edge disequilibrium dynamics involving delayed local extinctions and slow losses of ecosystem structural components. Interactions with habitat loss and invasive pests and pathogens are likely to further contribute to disequilibrium dynamics. Predictive modeling and climate-change experiments are increasingly representing disequilibrium dynamics, but with scope for improvement. Conclusions: The likely pervasiveness and complexity of vegetation disequilibrium is a major challenge for forecasting ecological dynamics and, combined with the high ecological importance of vegetation, also constitutes a major challenge for future nature conservation. {\textcopyright} 2013 Botanical Society of America.},

abstract = {Vegetation is a key driver of ecosystem functioning (e.g. productivity and stability) and of the maintenance of biodiversity (e.g. creating habitats for other species groups). While vegetation sensitivity to climate change has been widely investgated, its spatio-temporally response to the dual efects of land management and climate change has been ignored at landscape scale. Here we use a dynamic vegetation model called FATE-HD, which describes the dominant vegetation dynamics and associated functional diversity, in order to anticipate vegetation response to climate and land-use changes in both short and long-term perspectives. Using three contrasted management scenarios for the Ecrins National Park (French Alps) developed in collaboration with the park managers, and one regional climate change scenario, we tracked the dynamics of vegetation structure (forest expansion) and functional diversity over 100 years of climate change and a further 400 additional years of stabilization. As expected, we observed a slow upward shift in forest cover distribution, which appears to be severely impacted by pasture management (i.e. maintenance or abandonment). The tme lag before observing changes in vegetation cover was the result of demographic and seed dispersal processes. However, plant diversity response to environmental changes was rapid. Afer land abandonment, local diversity increased and spatial turnover was reduced, whereas local diversity decreased following land use intensification. Interestingly, in the long term, as both climate and management scenarios interacted, the regional diversity declined. Our innovative spatio-temporally explicit framework demonstrates that the vegetation may have contrasting responses to changes in the short and the long term. Moreover, climate and land-abandonment interact extensively leading to a decrease in both regional diversity and turnover in the long term. Based on our simulations we therefore suggest a continuing moderate intensity pasturing to maintain high levels of plant diversity in this system.},

abstract = {Summary: Anthropogenic global change compromises forest resilience, with profound impacts to ecosystem functions and services. This synthesis paper reflects on the current understanding of forest resilience and potential tipping points under environmental change and explores challenges to assessing responses using experiments, observations and models. Forests are changing over a wide range of spatio-temporal scales, but it is often unclear whether these changes reduce resilience or represent a tipping point. Tipping points may arise from interactions across scales, as processes such as climate change, land-use change, invasive species or deforestation gradually erode resilience and increase vulnerability to extreme events. Studies covering interactions across different spatio-temporal scales are needed to further our understanding. Combinations of experiments, observations and process-based models could improve our ability to project forest resilience and tipping points under global change. We discuss uncertainties in changing CO2 concentration and quantifying tree mortality as examples. Synthesis. As forests change at various scales, it is increasingly important to understand whether and how such changes lead to reduced resilience and potential tipping points. Understanding the mechanisms underlying forest resilience and tipping points would help in assessing risks to ecosystems and presents opportunities for ecosystem restoration and sustainable forest management.

abstract = {In both plant and animal systems, size can determine whether an individual survives and grows under different environmental conditions. However, it is unclear whether and when size-dependent responses to exogenous environmental fluctuations affect population dynamics. Size-by-environment interactions create pathways for environmental fluctuations to influence population dynamics by allowing for negative covariation between sizes within vital rates (e.g. small and large individuals have negatively covarying survival rates) and/or size-dependent variability in a vital rate (e.g. survival of large individuals varies less than small individuals through time). Whether these phenomena affect population dynamics depends on how they are mediated by elasticities (they must affect the sizes and vital rates that matter) and their projected impacts will depend on model functional form (the impact of reduced variance depends on the relationship between the environment and vital rate). We demonstrate these ideas with an analysis of fifteen species from five semiarid plant communities. We find that size-by-environment interactions are common but do not impact long-term population dynamics. Size-by-environment interactions may yet be important for other species. Our approach can be applied to species in other ecosystems to determine if and how size-by-environment interactions allow them to cope with, or exploit, fluctuating environments.},

abstract = {Examinations of upper elevational distribution limits of tree species can provide indications of how subalpine vegetation responds to the ongoing climate warming. Dynamics and functional mechanisms of elevational treelines are reasonably well understood, while explanations for tree species-specific upper elevational distribution limits below the treeline still remain unclear. In this study, we used a state-of-the-art dendroecological approach to reconstruct long-term changes of species-specific upper elevational distribution limits of different plant functional type (i.e., light-demanding deciduous coniferous larch at treeline, shade-tolerant evergreen coniferous fir and shade-intolerant deciduous broad-leaved birch below treeline) along elevational gradients in the Qinling Mountains of north-central China. Over the past three centuries, all the upper species limits shifted upslope as a response to climate warming. However, the warming-induced upslope migrations showed substantial differences, displaying the maximum upward shift of larch with an average elevation of 24.7 m during the past century, while only a slight advance of the non-treeline tree species. The disparity in elevational advance of upper species limits might be attributable to the presence of interspecific competition, showing that the non-treeline tree species experienced intermediate interspecific competition while the treeline tree species experienced no interspecific competition. Thus, our findings suggested that in addition to climate warming, biotic interaction may contribute much to shaping the species-specific upper limit dynamics. This study not only enhanced mechanistic understanding of long-term species-specific upper elevational distribution limit changes, but also highlighted the jointly effects of rising temperatures and species interactions on subalpine vegetation dynamics.},

abstract = {Indirect climate effects on tree fecundity that come through variation in size and growth (climate-condition interactions) are not currently part of models used to predict future forests. Trends in species abundances predicted from meta-analyses and species distribution models will be misleading if they depend on the conditions of individuals. Here we find from a synthesis of tree species in North America that climate-condition interactions dominate responses through two pathways, i) effects of growth that depend on climate, and ii) effects of climate that depend on tree size. Because tree fecundity first increases and then declines with size, climate change that stimulates growth promotes a shift of small trees to more fecund sizes, but the opposite can be true for large sizes. Change the depresses growth also affects fecundity. We find a biogeographic divide, with these interactions reducing fecundity in the West and increasing it in the East. Continental-scale responses of these forests are thus driven largely by indirect effects, recommending management for climate change that considers multiple demographic rates.},

@article{Paquette2011,
abstract = {Aim An important issue regarding biodiversity concerns its influence on ecosystem functioning. Experimental work has led to the proposal of mechanisms such as niche complementarity. However, few attempts have been made to confirm these in natural systems, especially in forests. Furthermore, one of the most interesting unresolved questions is whether the effects of complementarity on ecosystem functioning (EF) decrease in favour of competitive exclusions over an increasing productivity gradient. Using records from permanent forest plots, we asked the following questions. (1) Is tree productivity positively related to diversity? (2) Does the effect of diversity increase in less productive forests? (3) What metric of diversity (e.g. functional or phylogenetic diversity) better relates to tree productivity?Location Temperate, mixed and boreal forests of eastern Canada.Methods Over 12,000 permanent forest plots, from temperate to boreal forests, were used to test our hypotheses in two steps. (1) Stepwise regressions were used to identify the best explanatory variables for tree productivity. (2) The selected climatic and environmental variables, as well as density and biodiversity indices, were included in a structural equation model where links (paths) between covarying variables are made explicit, making structural equation modelling the best tool to explore such complicated causal networks.Results This is the first large-scale demonstration of a strong, positive and significant effect of biodiversity on tree productivity with control for climatic and environmental conditions. Important differences were noted between the two forest biomes investigated.Main conclusions We show for the first time that complementarity may be less important in temperate forests growing in a more stable and productive environment where competitive exclusion is the most probable outcome of species interactions, whereas in the more stressful environment of boreal forests, beneficial interactions between species may be more important. The present work is also a framework for the analysis of large datasets in biodiversity–ecosystem functioning (B-EF) research.},

Here we investigated the dispersal patterns and levels of genetic diversity and differentiation of both paternal and maternal gametes in a natural population of Pinus densiflora at the multiple-year scale as long as five consecutive years. Methods: We analyzed the paternity and maternity for 1576 seeds and 454 candidate adult trees using nuclear DNA polymorphisms of diploid biparental embryos and haploid maternal megagametophytes at eight microsatellite loci. Key results: Despite the low levels of genetic differentiation among gamete groups, a two-way AMOVA analysis showed that the parental origin (paternal vs. maternal gametes), the year of gamete production and their interaction had significant effects on the genetic composition of the seeds. While maternal gamete groups showed a significant FST value across the 5 years, this was not true for their paternal counterparts. Within the population, we found that the relative reproductive contributions of the paternal vs. the maternal parent differed among adult trees, the maternal contributions showing a larger year-to-year fluctuation. Conclusions: The overall genetic variability of dispersed seeds appeared to result from two sources of heterogeneity: the difference between paternal and maternal patterns of reproduction and gamete dispersal and year-to-year heterogeneity of reproduction of adult trees, especially in their maternal reproduction. {\textcopyright} 2013 Botanical Society of America.},

We investigate the population genetics of Ptilotus macrocephalus a perennial herb that occurs in two nationally endangered communities on the Victorian Volcanic Plain Bioregion (VVP), Australia, to answer key questions regarding regional differentiation and to guide conservation strategies. We evaluate genetic structure and diversity within and among 17 P. macrocephalus populations from 3 regions of southeastern Australia using 17 microsatellite markers developed de novo. Genetic structure was present in P. macrocephalusbetween the three regions but not at the population level. Environmental factors, namely temperature and precipitation, significantly explained differentiation between the North region and the other two regions indicating isolation by environment. Within regions, genetic structure currently shows a high level of gene flow and genetic variation. Our results suggest that within-region gene flow does not reflect current habitat fragmentation in southeastern Australia whereas temperature and precipitation are likely to be responsible for the differentiation detected among regions. Climate change may severely impact P. macrocephalus on the VVP and test its evolutionary resilience. We suggest taking a proactive conservation approach to improve long-term viability by sourcing material for restoration to assist gene flow to the VVP region to promote an increased adaptive capacity.},

Methods We reviewed milestones in the evolution of forest dynamics models from the 1930s to the present with emphasis on forest growth and yield models and forest landscape models We combined past trends with emerging issues to identify future needs. Results Historically, capacity to model forest dynamics at tree, stand, and landscape scales was constrained by available data for model calibration and validation; computing capacity; model applica-bility to real-world problems; and ability to integrate biological, social, and economic drivers of change. As computing and data resources improved, a new class of spatially explicit forest landscape models emerged. Conclusions We are at a point of great opportunity in development and application of forest dynamics mod-els. Past limitations in computing capacity and in data suitable for model calibration or evaluation are becom-ing less restrictive. Forest landscape models, in partic-ular, are ready to transition to a central role supporting forest management, planning, and policy decisions.

Using long-term demography data from permanent forest plots at the Paracou Tropical Forest Research Station in French Guiana, we analysed the relative influence of competition and climate on tree mortality. We found that self-thinning is evident at the stand level, and is associated with clumped mortality at smaller scales ({\textless}2 m) and regular spacing of living trees at intermediate (2.5–7.5 m) scales. A competition index (CI) based on spatial clustering of dead trees was used to build predictive mortality models, which also accounted for climate interactions. The model that most closely fitted observations included both the CI and climatic variables, with climate-only and competition-only models less informative than the full model. There was strong evidence for U-shaped size-specific mortality, with highest mortality for small and very large trees, as well as sensitivity of trees to drought, especially when temperatures were high, and when soils were water saturated. The effect of the CI was more complex than expected a priori: a higher CI was associated with lower mortality odds, which we hypothesize is caused by gap-phase dynamics, but there was also evidence for competition-induced mortality at very high CI values. The strong signature of competition as a control over mortality at the stand and individual scales confirms its important role in determining tropical forest structure. The complexity of the competition-mortality relationship and its interaction with climate indicates that a thorough consideration of the scale of analysis is needed when inferring the role of competition in tropical forests, but demonstrates that climate-only mortality models can be significantly improved by including competition effects, even when ignoring species-specific effects. Synthesis. Empirical models such as the one developed here can help constrain and improve process-based vegetation models, serving both as a benchmark and as a means to disentangle mortality processes. Tropical vegetation dynamic models would benefit greatly from explicitly considering the role of competition in stand development and self-thinning while modelling demography, as well as its interaction with climate.},

abstract = {Climate change is expected to alter the distribution and abundance of tree species, impacting ecosystem structure and function. Yet, anticipating where this will occur is often hampered by a lack of understanding of how demographic rates, most notably recruitment, vary in response to climate and competition across a species range. Using large-scale monitoring data on two dry woodland tree species (Pinus edulis and Juniperus osteosperma), we develop an approach to infer recruitment, survival, and growth of both species across their range. In doing so, we account for ecological and statistical dependencies inherent in large-scale monitoring data. We find that drying and warming conditions generally lead to declines in recruitment and survival, but the strength of responses varied between species. These climate conditions point to geographic regions of high vulnerability for particular species, such as Pinus edulis in northern Arizona, where both survival and recruitment are low. Our approach provides a path forward for leveraging emerging large-scale monitoring and remotely sensed data to anticipate the impacts of global change on species distributions.},

abstract = {A difficulty in using diffusion models to predict large scale animal population dispersal is that individuals move differently based on local information (as opposed to gradients) in differing habitat types. This can be accommodated by using ecological diffusion. However, real environments are often spatially complex, limiting application of a direct approach. Homogenization for partial differential equations has long been applied to Fickian diffusion (in which average individual movement is organized along gradients of habitat and population density). We derive a homogenization procedure for ecological diffusion and apply it to a simple model for chronic wasting disease in mule deer. Homogenization allows us to determine the impact of small scale (10-100 m) habitat variability on large scale (10-100 km) movement. The procedure generates asymptotic equations for solutions on the large scale with parameters defined by small-scale variation. The simplicity of this homogenization procedure is striking when compared to the multi-dimensional homogenization procedure for Fickian diffusion,and the method will be equally straightforward for more complex models.},

This paper proposes a global sensitivity analysis methodology for stochastic computer codes, for which the result of each code run is itself random. The framework of the joint modeling of the mean and dispersion of heteroscedastic data is used. To deal with the complexity of computer experiment outputs, nonparametric joint models are discussed and a new Gaussian process-based joint model is proposed. The relevance of these models is analyzed based upon two case studies. Results show that the joint modeling approach yields accurate sensitivity index estimators even when heteroscedasticity is strong. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract = {Questions: 1. Do the species composition, richness and diversity of sapling communities vary significantly in differently sized patches? 2. Do forest patches of different sizes differ in woody plant colonization patterns? Location: Sa?o Francisco de Paula, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, 29°28' S, 50°13' W. Methods: Three woody vegetation types, differing in structural development (patch size) and recovering for 10 years from cattle and burning disturbances, were sampled on grassland. We analysed the composition and complexity of the woody sapling communities, through relative abundance, richness and diversity patterns. We also evaluated recruitment status (residents vs. colonizers) of species in communities occurring in different forest patch size classes. Results: 1. There is a compositional gradient in sapling communities strongly associated with forest patch area. 2. Richness and diversity are positively correlated to patch area, but only in poorly structured patches; large patches present richness and diversity values similar to small patches. 3. Resident to colonizer abundance ratio increases from nurse plants to large patches. The species number proportion between residents and colonizers is similar in small and large patches and did not differ between these patch types. 4. Large patches presented a high number of exclusive species, while nurse plants and small patches did not. Conclusions: Woody plant communities in Araucaria forest patches are associated with patch structure development. Richness and diversity patterns are linked to patch colonization patterns. Generalist species colonize the understorey of nurse plants and small patches; resident species cannot recruit many new individuals. In large patches, sapling recruitment by resident adults precludes the immigration of new species into the patches, limiting richness and diversity. {\textcopyright} IAVS; Opulus Press.},

It highlights some of the key normative decisions that have to be taken, in particular, the role of compensation over time (whether poverty spells can be compensated for by non-poverty spells); the issue of the discount rate (whether each spell should be given an equal weight); and the issue of the role of persistence (whether repeated spells should be given a higher weight). It offers a number of plausible poverty measures, each with different assumptions regarding these key issues, and shows how these insights can be used to construct a forward-looking measure of vulnerability. The chapter applies a number of these measures to data from rural Ethiopia, and shows that while correlations are high, there would still be considerable differences in ranking households by poverty according to different measures, especially those that have different views on the role of compensation},

Here, we distinguish these concepts, discuss their operationalization, and identify the objectives that each is suited to. Resilience is useful when ecosystems risk losing the ability to recover and requires system modelling. Vulnerability can either be quantitative, measuring the ability of a system to remain above a critical threshold, or qualitative and used to evaluate the exposure of a system to disturbance and attributes that confer adaptive capacity and sensitivity to disturbance. As such, vulnerability is well-suited to assessments of coupled social-ecological systems. Robustness measures the ability of a system to maintain itself within a narrow range of function and is ideally suited to problems that require careful setting of upper and lower bounds for system properties, such as optimal fisheries yield. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Weed dynamics models are essential for assessing crop management techniques and cropping systems. They must include a competition model that accounts for the particular characteristics of crop:weed stands, i.e. heterogeneous canopies consisting of contrasting species presenting a high morphological plasticity and resulting from successive emergence flushes. In a previous study, we developed a model which predicts light incidence and absorption in each location of a 3D, individual-based canopy as a function of plant morphology, latitude and seasonal solar height. Plant morphology was simplified to a set of five plant traits (plant height, diameter, leaf vs. non-leaf biomass ratio, specific leaf area and median leaf distribution height). Here, the objective was to propose and parameterize a new modelling approach for predicting these simplified morphological variables as a function of two effects that are notoriously difficult to separate (1) plant biomass which results from past light absorption and determines a large part of the current competitive ability and (2) past and current shading to integrate changes in morphology resulting from plant response to shading. A field experiment was sown with oilseed rape in September. Gaps were artificially created in the canopy by removing seedlings after emergence; additional bare-soil plots were created. Target plants of one grass weed species (Alopecurus myosuroides), three broadleaved weed species (Galium aparine, Sinapis arvensis, Stellaria media), and one broadleaved crop species (oilseed rape) were transplanted into the various canopy scenarios. Target and canopy plants were sampled five times from October to April to determine the morphological variables. A shading index was calculated from incident light averaged over each target plant from predictions with the light availability submodel. A single equation was successfully fitted to each morphological variable, estimating parameters in shadeless conditions, a correlation parameter with plant biomass (for height and diameter only), and a parameter representing sensitivity to shading for each variable, species and date. Plant biomass decreased in the shade but plants were taller with more stem biomass (except in grass weeds) and larger/thinner leaves concentrated towards the top of the plant. The grass species was least plastic; among the broadleaved species, the crop species presented the least plasticity. The light availability and the plasticity submodels were combined to simulate the effect of crop sowing densities and patterns (row-sown vs. broadcast, varying interrow widths) on weed morphological variables. The latter was more altered in dense and in row-sown vs. broadcast canopies but its range of variation was smaller in the former, pointing to a more selective and less diverse environment. The consequences for weed adaptation to crops and for optimizing crop and cultivar choices were discussed.},

abstract = {Dispersal affects community dynamics and vegetation response to global change. Understanding these effects requires descriptions of dispersal at local and regional scales and statistical models that permit estimation. Classical models of dispersal describe local or long-distance dispersal, but not both. The lack of statistical methods means that models have rarely been fitted to seed dispersal in closed forests. We present a mixture model of dispersal that assumes a range of disperal patterns, both local and long distance. The bivariate Student's t or "2Dt" follows from an assumption that the distance parameter in a Gaussian model varies randomly, thus having a density of its own. We use an inverse approach to "compete" our mixture model against classical alternatives, using seed rain databases from temperate broadleaf, temperate mixed-conifer, and tropical floodplain forests. For most species, the 2Dt model fits dispersal data better than do classical models, The superior fit results from the potential for a convex shape near the source tree and a "fat tail." Our parameter estimates have implications for community dynamics at local scales, for vegetation responses to global change at regional scales, and for differences in seed dispersal among biomes. The 2Dt model predicts that less seed travels beyond the immediate crown influence (30 m). Although Gaussian and exponential models predict slow population spread in the face of environmental change, our dispersal estimates suggest rapid spread. The preponderance of animal-dispersed and rare seed types in tropical forests results in noisier patterns of dispersal than occur in temperate hardwood and conifer stands.},

Instead of asking whether niches or neutral processes structure communities, we advocate determining the degree to which observed diversity reflects strong stabilizing mechanisms overcoming large fitness differences or weak stabilization operating on species of similar fitness. To answer this question, we propose combining data on per capita growth rates with models to: (i) quantify the strength of stabilizing processes; (ii) quantify fitness inequality and compare it with stabilization; and (iii) manipulate frequency dependence in growth to test the consequences of stabilization and fitness equivalence for coexistence.},

We examine whether the combined influence of climate change and timber harvest will affect tree species distribution and productivity beyond predictions based on climate alone. We used the landscape disturbance model LANDIS-II to simulate two climate and two harvest scenarios in 14,000 ha of managed watersheds. The elevated temperature led to a decline in the abundance of boreal species and a substantial increase in some temperate and pioneer species. Importantly, the interaction of climate change and timber harvest yielded changes in the distribution of some species that would not be expected based on climate alone. Conversely, some late-successional species exhibited resistance to climate-driven changes in their distribution. Climate change caused an increase in forest productivity when harvest was simulated, but a decrease in no-harvest scenarios. A time lag in forest response was likely responsible for this decrease in the absence of widespread mortality. The finding that disturbance may drive the range expansion of early-successional broadleaved species and cause a decline of red spruce has implications for forest community associations, as well as for forest management where conifers are favoured for pulp production.},

In some areas, forest management practices are intensifying, whereas in other areas, lower-impact ecological methods are being used. Interactions among these changing factors are likely to alter ecosystem structure and function at regional to continental scales. A macrosystems approach is essential to assessing the broadscale impacts of these changes and quantify cross-scale interactions, emergent patterns, and feedbacks. A promising line of analysis is the assimilation of data with ecosystem models to scale processes to the macrosystem and generate projections based on alternative scenarios. Analyses of these projections can characterize the range of future variability in forest function and provide information to guide policy, industry, and science in a changing world.},

abstract = {Overhunting in tropical forests reduces populations of vertebrate seed dis- persers. If reduced seed dispersal has a negative impact on tree population viability, overhunting could lead to altered forest structure and dynamics, including decreased biodiversity. However, empirical data show- ing decreased animal-dispersed tree abundance in overhunted forests contradict demographic models which predict minimal sensitivity of tree population growth rate to early life stages. One resolution to this discre- pancy is that seed dispersal determines spatial aggregation, which could have demographic consequences for all life stages. We tested the impact of dispersal loss on population viability of a tropical tree species, Miliusa hors- fieldii, currently dispersed by an intact community of large mammals in a Thai forest. We evaluated the effect of spatial aggregation for all tree life stages, from seeds to adult trees, and constructed simulation models to com- pare population viability with and without animal-mediated seed dispersal. In simulated populations, disperser loss increased spatial aggregation by fourfold, leading to increased negative density dependence across the life cycle and a 10-fold increase in the probability of extinction.

abstract = {Ecophylogenetics can be viewed as an emerging fusion of ecology, biogeography and macroevolution. This new and fast-growing field is promoting the incorporation of evolution and historical contingencies into the ecological research agenda through the widespread use of phylogenetic data. Including phylogeny into ecological thinking represents an opportunity for biologists from different fields to collaborate and has provided promising avenues of research in both theoretical and empirical ecology, towards a better understanding of the assembly of communities, the functioning of ecosystems and their responses to environmental changes. The time is ripe to assess critically the extent to which the integration of phylogeny into these different fields of ecology has delivered on its promise. Here we review how phylogenetic information has been used to identify better the key components of species interactions with their biotic and abiotic environments, to determine the relationships between diversity and ecosystem functioning and ultimately to establish good management practices to protect overall biodiversity in the face of global change. We evaluate the relevance of information provided by phylogenies to ecologists, highlighting current potential weaknesses and needs for future developments. We suggest that despite the strong progress that has been made, a consistent unified framework is still missing to link local ecological dynamics to macroevolution. This is a necessary step in order to interpret observed phylogenetic patterns in a wider ecological context. Beyond the fundamental question of how evolutionary history contributes to shape communities, ecophylogenetics will help ecology to become a better integrative and predictive science.},

abstract = {The Wollemi pine (Wollemia nobilis) is a rare Southern conifer with striking morphological similarity to fossil pines. A small population of W. nobilis was discovered in 1994 in a remote canyon system in the Wollemi National Park (near Sydney, Australia). This population contains fewer than 100 individuals and is critically endangered. Previous genetic studies of the Wollemi pine have investigated its evolutionary relationship with other pines in the family Araucariaceae, and have suggested that the Wollemi pine genome contains little or no variation. However, these studies were performed prior to the widespread use of genome sequencing, and their conclusions were based on a limited fraction of the Wollemi pine genome. In this study, we address this problem by determining the entire sequence of the W. nobilis chloroplast genome. A detailed analysis of the structure of the genome is presented, and the evolution of the genome is inferred by comparison with the chloroplast sequences of other members of the Araucariaceae and the related family Podocarpaceae. Pairwise alignments of whole genome sequences, and the presence of unique pseudogenes, gene duplications and insertions in W. nobilis and Araucariaceae, indicate that the W. nobilis chloroplast genome is most similar to that of its sister taxon Agathis. However, the W. nobilis genome contains an unusually high number of repetitive sequences, and these could be used in future studies to investigate and conserve any remnant genetic diversity in the Wollemi pine.},

abstract = {Environmental filtering, where the environment selects against certain species, is thought to be a major mechanism structuring communities. However, recent criticisms cast doubt on our ability to accurately infer filtering because competition can give rise to patterns identical to those caused by environmental filtering. While experiments can distinguish mechanisms, observational patterns are especially problematic. The environment determines community composition not only directly via survival, but also by influencing competition. If species population growth rates covary with environmental gradients, then outcomes of competitive exclusion will also vary with the environment. Here, we argue that observational studies remain valuable, but inferences about the importance of the environment cannot rely on compositional data alone, and that species abundances, population growth, or traits must be correlated with the environment.},

abstract = {Biotic interactions can influence the ranges and abundances of species, but no clear guidelines exist for integrating them into correlative models of niches and distributions. Niche/distributional models characterize environmental/habitat suitability or species presence using predictor variables unaffected by (= unlinked to) the population of the focal species. Such variables (termed ‘scenopoetic') typically have been considered to include only abiotic factors. In contrast, population–demographic approaches model the abundance of the focal species by including linked predictor variables, which frequently are biotic interactors. Nevertheless, a focal species might hold no, or negligible, population-level effects on its biotic interactors. Hence, contrary to current theory, such interactors would represent unlinked variables valid and potentially very useful for niche/distributional models. Consideration of population-level effects indicates that facilitators and affecting amensals (species that negatively affect another species but are not affected by it) constitute unlinked variables, but commensals and affected amensals do not. For competitors, mutualists, predators/prey, consumers/resources, and parasites/hosts, additional information is necessary. Specifically, available ecological/natural history information for the particular species involved (e.g. regarding specificity) and theory regarding ecological networks can allow identification of interactors that are likely to be unlinked or nearly so. Including an unlinked biotic interactor as a predictor variable in a niche/distributional model should improve predictions when the effects of the biotic interactor vary across the study region, or in another place or time period. Other relevant interactors must be taken into account by post-processing a niche/distributional model, or via population–demographic models that require abundance data over time. This framework should improve current correlative models and highlights areas requiring progress.},

This resulting synthesis and summation effort, culminating over two decades of work, provides a detailed data set that incorporates habitat quality, land cover, and dispersal potential, spatially constrained, for nearly all the tree species of the eastern United States.

abstract = {Survival rates of large trees determine forest biomass dynamics. Survival rates of small trees have been linked to mechanisms that maintain biodiversity across tropical forests. How species survival rates change with size offers insight into the links between biodiversity and ecosystem function across tropical forests. We tested patterns of size-dependent tree survival across the tropics using data from 1,781 species and over 2 million individuals to assess whether tropical forests can be characterized by size-dependent life-history survival strategies. We found that species were classifiable into four ‘survival modes' that explain life-history variation that shapes carbon cycling and the relative abundance within forests. Frequently collected functional traits, such as wood density, leaf mass per area and seed mass, were not generally predictive of the survival modes of species. Mean annual temperature and cumulative water deficit predicted the proportion of biomass of survival modes, indicating important links between evolutionary strategies, climate and carbon cycling. The application of survival modes in demographic simulations predicted biomass change across forest sites. Our results reveal globally identifiable size-dependent survival strategies that differ across diverse systems in a consistent way. The abundance of survival modes and interaction with climate ultimately determine forest structure, carbon storage in biomass and future forest trajectories.},

abstract = {Seedlings of Brazil pine, a large-seeded South American conifer, were grown in a climate chamber to investigate vertical growth pattern and the time course of leaf development. We examined shoot growth, photosynthetic performance and markers of leaf maturation such as contents of soluble sugars and activities of sucrose-phosphate synthase (SPS), neutral invertase (nI) and sucrose synthase (Susy). The daily increment of shoot length showed an optimum curve during the first 70 days after germination. The low growth rate during the first 20 days of development correlated with net CO2 emission of the seedling. Analyses of leaf maturation markers in older seedlings revealed low sucrose/hexose ratios and high activities of nI and Susy in the uppermost leaves. Although the SPS/Susy ratio was low in these leaves the extractable SPS activity did not change significantly among leaves of different age. The photosynthetic light compensation points of young leaves were about 2-fold higher than those of mature leaves and their photosynthetic capacity was only 50{\%} as high. Our results indicate that a rapid maturation of leaves of Brazil pine seedlings may reduce the respiratory loss of carbohydrates and that the mobilisation of seed storage compounds supports initial shoot growth under light-limiting conditions which may occur in the forest-grassland succession zone.},

@article{Colwell2012,
abstract = {AimsIn ecology and conservation biology, the number of species counted in a biodiversity study is a key metric but is usually a biased underestimate of total species richness because many rare species are not detected. Moreover, comparing species richness among sites or samples is a statistical challenge because the observed number of species is sensitive to the number of individuals counted or the area sampled. For individual-based data, we treat a single, empirical sample of species abundances from an investigator-defined species assemblage or community as a reference point for two estimation objectives under two sampling models: estimating the expected number of species (and its unconditional variance) in a random sample of (i) a smaller number of individuals (multinomial model) or a smaller area sampled (Poisson model) and (ii) a larger number of individuals or a larger area sampled. For sample-based incidence (presence-absence) data, under a Bernoulli product model, we treat a single set of species incidence frequencies as the reference point to estimate richness for smaller and larger numbers of sampling units. MethodsThe first objective is a problem in interpolation that we address with classical rarefaction (multinomial model) and Coleman rarefaction (Poisson model) for individual-based data and with sample-based rarefaction (Bernoulli product model) for incidence frequencies. The second is a problem in extrapolation that we address with sampling-theoretic predictors for the number of species in a larger sample (multinomial model), a larger area (Poisson model) or a larger number of sampling units (Bernoulli product model), based on an estimate of asymptotic species richness. Although published methods exist for many of these objectives, we bring them together here with some new estimators under a unified statistical and notational framework. This novel integration of mathematically distinct approaches allowed us to link interpolated (rarefaction) curves and extrapolated curves to plot a unified species accumulation curve for empirical examples. We provide new, unconditional variance estimators for classical, individual-based rarefaction and for Coleman rarefaction, long missing from the toolkit of biodiversity measurement. We illustrate these methods with datasets for tropical beetles, tropical trees and tropical ants. Important FindingsSurprisingly, for all datasets we examined, the interpolation (rarefaction) curve and the extrapolation curve meet smoothly at the reference sample, yielding a single curve. Moreover, curves representing 95{\%} confidence intervals for interpolated and extrapolated richness estimates also meet smoothly, allowing rigorous statistical comparison of samples not only for rarefaction but also for extrapolated richness values. The confidence intervals widen as the extrapolation moves further beyond the reference sample, but the method gives reasonable results for extrapolations up to about double or triple the original abundance or area of the reference sample. We found that the multinomial and Poisson models produced indistinguishable results, in units of estimated species, for all estimators and datasets. For sample-based abundance data, which allows the comparison of all three models, the Bernoulli product model generally yields lower richness estimates for rarefied data than either the multinomial or the Poisson models because of the ubiquity of non-random spatial distributions in nature.},

The two taxonomic groups with the most species causing impacts are terrestrial invertebrates and terrestrial plants. The North Sea is the maritime region that suffers the most impacts.

Terrestrial invertebrates create greater economic impacts than ecological impacts, while the reverse is true for terrestrial plants.

abstract = {The belief that canopy gaps are important for the maintenance of tree species diversity appears to be widespread, but there have been no formal theoretical models to assess under what conditions gap phase processes allow coexistence. Much of the empirical research on niche differentiation in response to gaps has focused on evidence for an interspecific tradeoff between low light survival and high light growth. The objectives of this study are first to distinguish the possible mechanisms allowing coexistence based on this tradeoff, and second, to explore their limitations. We present a theory of forest dynamics driven by small-scale disturbances as a special case of the theory of coexistence in variable environments. We demonstrate that temporal and spatial heterogeneity in light conditions that results from canopy gaps can allow stable coexistence as a result of three previously documented general mechanisms: ‘relative non-linearity', ‘the successional niche' and the ‘storage effect'. We find that temporal fluctuations in light availability alone allow the stable coexistence of only two species. Spatial variation in disturbance synchronicity and intensity allows three species to coexist in a narrow parameter space. The rate of extinction is, however, extremely slow and there is transient coexistence of a larger number of species for a long period of time. We conclude that while the low light survival/high light growth tradeoff may be ubiquitous in forest tree species, it is unlikely to function as an important mechanism for the stable coexistence of several tree species.},

abstract = {Blackgrass (Alopecurus myosuroides Huds.) is an annual weed frequently found in winter crops and increasingly tolerant to herbicides. To manage this weed with less or no herbicides, the model ALOMYSYS was developed to quantify the effects of cropping systems on the demography of blackgrass. The sub-model for seed survival, dormancy, germination and pre-emergent growth was described in a previous paper. This paper presents the sub-model quantifying seedling survival, tillering, heading, flowering and seed production, as a function of the weed emergence date and density (predicted by the seed bank sub-model), the crops grown in the field, the cultivation techniques used to manage the crop (tillage, sowing, herbicides, nitrogen, harvest) and the climate (temperature, rainfall). The sub-model is based on the annual life-cycle of blackgrass; the relationship between the various life-stages depends on the model input variables and on the characteristics of the weed population (e.g. tillering decreases with weed density, herbicide efficacy decreases with plant stage and density, etc.). The equations describing the life-stages and processes were deduced from previous greenhouse experiments and field trials. The resulting model was evaluated by comparing the simulations to independent field observations. This validation showed the model to accurately predict weed stages for a given year as well as the dynamics over the years, in contrasted cropping systems. The model can thus be used to evaluate and design new cropping systems for integrated crop protection. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Seeds were collected from 13 seed trees inside the forest cluster and from eight seed trees in the open forest. Our results showed that the adults present high levels of heterozygosity (H o = 0.91) and an absence of inbreeding. However, significant SGS was detected up to 90 m in the forest cluster suggesting that near-neighbor trees are related. The estimate of effective population size was lower than the total number of trees in the cluster (N e/N = 0.19), which can be explained by the presence of SGS in the stand. Substantial external pollen flow was detected in the forest cluster (26 {\%}) and open forest (20 {\%}), indicating that the reproductive population size is greater than the sampled populations, explaining the high genetic diversity in this population. Our results indicate that this site has potential for in and ex situ conservation due to high levels of genetic diversity and gene immigration resulting from pollen flow. Conservation strategies for A. angustifolia should focus not only on forest fragments but should also include the preservation of isolated trees throughout the landscape.},

abstract = {Biogeography has traditionally focused on the spatial distribution and abundance of species. Both are driven by the way species interact with one another, but also by the way these interactions vary across time and space. Here, we call for an integrated approach, adopting the view that community structure is best represented as a network of ecological interactions, and show how it translates to biogeography questions. We propose that the ecological niche should encompass the effect of the environment on species distribution (the Grinnellian dimension of the niche) and on the ecological interactions among them (the Eltonian dimension). Starting from this concept, we develop a quantitative theory to explain turnover of interactions in space and time i.e. a novel approach to interaction distribution modelling. We apply this framework to host parasite interactions across Europe and find that two aspects of the environment (temperature and precipitation) exert a strong imprint on species co-occurrence, but not on species interactions. Even where species co-occur, interaction proves to be stochastic rather than deterministic, adding to variation in realized network structure. We also find that a large majority of host-parasite pairs are never found together, thus precluding any inferences regarding their probability to interact. This first attempt to explain variation of network structure at large spatial scales opens new perspectives at the interface of species distribution modelling and community ecology.},

abstract = {Numerous current efforts seek to improve the representation of ecosystem ecology and vegetation demographic processes within Earth System Models (ESMs). These developments are widely viewed as an important step in developing greater realism in predictions of future ecosystem states and fluxes. Increased realism, however, leads to increased model complexity, with new features raising a suite of ecological questions that require empirical constraints. Here, we review the developments that permit the representation of plant demographics in ESMs, and identify issues raised by these developments that highlight important gaps in ecological understanding. These issues inevitably translate into uncertainty in model projections but also allow models to be applied to new processes and questions concerning the dynamics of real-world ecosystems. We argue that stronger and more innovative connections to data, across the range of scales considered, are required to address these gaps in understanding. The development of first-generation land surface models as a unifying framework for ecophysiological understanding stimulated much research into plant physiological traits and gas exchange. Constraining predictions at ecologically relevant spatial and temporal scales will require a similar investment of effort and intensified inter-disciplinary communication.

Like many grasslands around the world, the Campos grasslands are declining with few conservation efforts underway. In contrast, forests receive much attention and many incentives. It is hypothesized that perception of land cover has the potential to shape ecosystems. Here we conduct a questionnaire to further our understanding of decision-making practices that alter landscapes (Campos grassland, Araucaria forest, agriculture and plantation) and direct land policies in the region. Our analysis reveals that plantations are significantly less desirable than the other landscape types. However, plantation land use has increased by 87 {\%} over the past few decades, as a result of industry and government incentives. The proportions of other landscape types have remained consistent over the past two decades. Restoration of native vegetation is not a priority of landowners and restoration would require a financial incentive. {\textcopyright} 2015, The Author(s).},

abstract = {1. In a rapidly changing world, ecology has the potential to move from empirical and conceptual stages to application and management issues. It is now possible to make large-scale predictions up to continental or global scales, ranging from the future distribution of biological diversity to changes in ecosystem functioning and services. With these recent developments, ecology has a historical opportunity to become a major actor in the development of a sustainable human society. With this opportunity, however, also comes an important responsibility in developing appropriate predictive models, correctly interpreting their outcomes, and communicating their limitations. There is also a danger that predictions grow faster than our understanding of ecological systems, resulting in a gap between the scientists generating the predictions and stakeholders using them (conservation biologists, environmental managers, journalists, policymakers). 2. Here we use the context provided by the current surge of ecological predictions on the future of biodiversity to clarify what prediction means, and to pinpoint the challenges that should be addressed in order to improve predictive ecological models and the way they are understood and used. 3. Synthesis and applications. Ecologists face several challenges to ensure the healthy development of an operational predictive ecological science: (i) clarity on the distinction between explanatory and anticipatory predictions; (ii) developing new theories at the interface between explanatory and anticipatory predictions; (iii) open data to test and validate predictions; (iv) making predictions operational and (v) developing a genuine ethics of prediction.},

The model integrates the effects of crop succession and crop management at the level of a region. The first part of the model presented in this paper describes the temporal evolution of rapeseed volunteers in a field, using an annual life-cycle comprising stages such as seed bank, seedlings, adult plants, flowers or freshly produced seeds. The relationships between the various stages depend on the crops grown each year and the cultivation techniques (stubble breaking, soil tillage, sowing date and density, herbicides, cutting and harvesting). Parameter values were either deduced from existing models and literature, or estimated from experimental studies and field surveys. The extension of the temporal sub-model to include the genetic evolution of rapeseed volunteers and the spatial dimension is presented in a second paper [Colbach, N., Clermont-Dauphin, C., Meynard, J.M., 2001, Agric.

abstract = {Two large-scale weed surveys conducted on winter wheat crops in France in the 1970s and the 2000s were used to determine the influence of management on weed communities. A trait-based approach was used to identify the mechanisms associated with the changing status of arable weeds over a 30 year period.A three-table ordination method (RLQ analysis) of the data set was performed to relate the environmental table to the species trait table using a species composition table to extract the joint structure (synchronic analysis). We then conducted a diachronic analysis to investigate the relationship between traits, alone or in combination, and the changing status of weeds.The synchronic analysis showed that tillage intensity filtered weeds according to height, seed weight, life forms and dispersal. Conversely, herbicides selected for species with delayed germination, which allows them to escape herbicide treatments. The diachronic analysis showed that successful weeds that have expanded were small plants, with rather light seeds, that can germinate over a long time frame during the vegetative period. This trait syndrome was probably favoured by profound changes in crop rotation and by increasing herbicide pressure. Our approach provides an excellent example of how future shifts in weed communities can be predicted and hence how weed management can be adapted so as to avoid promoting selection of problematic weeds. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Communities consist of species and their interactions. They can thus be described as networks, with species as nodes and interactions as links. Within such networks, the diversity of nodes and the distribution of links may affect patterns of energy transfer between trophic levels, the dynamics of the system, and the outcome in terms of ecosystem functioning. To date, most descriptions of networks have focused on single or relatively few sites, and have oftentimes been built on poorly resolved nodes and links. Yet, comparisons of local interaction networks reveal variation in space and in time, thus spurring interest in methods and theory for understanding patterns, drivers, and consequences of this variation. Progress in this field relies on access to replicate samples of comparable food webs across large spatiotemporal scales, resolved to species rather than to compound nodes. Due to the massive efforts required, high-quality data sets are still scarce. We created a data set on a single community type sampled across Europe: willow species (Salix), willow-galling sawflies (Hymenoptera: Tenthredinidae: Nematinae: Euurina), and their natural enemies (hymenopteran parasitoids and coleopteran, lepidopteran, dipteran, and hymenopteran inquilines). Each sample was referenced in space and time, and each node resolved with the highest possible resolution, including taxonomic affinity, gall type (for herbivores), and mode of parasitism (for natural enemies). Galler survival and link structure were resolved by dissection and rearing of gall inhabitants. In total, the data set is based on 641 site visits over 29 years, and on 165,424 galls representing 96 herbivore nodes and 52 plant nodes. The dissections and rearings yielded 42,129 natural enemies belonging to 126 species, and revealed 1,173 different links. The spatiotemporal and taxonomic resolution of these data make them amenable to analyses of both ecological and evolutionary processes of network assembly. Thus, this data set will facilitate testing of important hypotheses in recent community theory, concerning, e.g., the sampling effort needed to adequately describe interaction structure within ecological communities, the impact of environmental conditions and biotic filters on the distribution of species and their interactions, and the relationship between the global “metaweb” and its local realizations.},

A reduction in dry mass accumulation was observed in the shaded plants. These plants also had an initial enhancement of height growth, accumulated more chlorophyll, and, by the end of the experiment, had branched less and attained a greater leaf area ratio than the control plants. These morphological and physiological changes, which exhibited a temporally discontinuous expression, were interpreted as adjustments towards a more efficient light absorption and resource conservation under shading, which may contribute to the reported hade tolerance of the species.},

abstract = {Two main sources of data for species distribution models (SDMs) are site-occupancy (SO) data from planned surveys, and presence-background (PB) data from opportunistic surveys and other sources. SO surveys give high quality data about presences and absences of the species in a particular area. However, due to their high cost, they often cover a smaller area relative to PB data, and are usually not representative of the geographic range of a species. In contrast, PB data is plentiful, covers a larger area, but is less reliable due to the lack of information on species absences, and is usually characterised by biased sampling. Here we present a new approach for species distribution modelling that integrates these two data types. We have used an inhomogeneous Poisson point process as the basis for constructing an integrated SDM that fits both PB and SO data simultaneously. It is the first implementation of an Integrated SO–PB Model which uses repeated survey occupancy data and also incorporates detection probability. The Integrated Model's performance was evaluated, using simulated data and compared to approaches using PB or SO data alone. It was found to be superior, improving the predictions of species spatial distributions, even when SO data is sparse and collected in a limited area. The Integrated Model was also found effective when environmental covariates were significantly correlated. Our method was demonstrated with real SO and PB data for the Yellow-bellied glider (Petaurus australis) in south-eastern Australia, with the predictive performance of the Integrated Model again found to be superior. PB models are known to produce biased estimates of species occupancy or abundance. The small sample size of SO datasets often results in poor out-of-sample predictions. Integrated models combine data from these two sources, providing superior predictions of species abundance compared to using either data source alone. Unlike conventional SDMs which have restrictive scale-dependence in their predictions, our Integrated Model is based on a point process model and has no such scale-dependency. It may be used for predictions of abundance at any spatial-scale while still maintaining the underlying relationship between abundance and area.},

abstract = {Abstract Forecasting the impacts of climate change on biological diversity requires better ways to incorporate competitive interactions into predictions of species? range dynamics and persistence. This problem has been studied extensively in a different context by theoreticians evaluating the coexistence of species in spatially heterogeneous environments. Here, we show how spatial coexistence theory can be adapted to provide a mathematical framework for understanding species persistence in competitive communities under climate change. We first show how the spatial low-density growth rate provides the relevant metric of species persistence along a climate gradient. We then analyse a model of multiple migrating competitors to show how mechanisms contributing to low-density growth rates quantify the effect of different competitive processes on persistence, and how these processes change in strength with species? asynchronous migration under climate change. Finally, we outline the empirical utility of the framework, showing how the theory can scale up from local measurements of species performance and competitive interactions to range-scale metrics of persistence. Treating species? range dynamics as a geographical-scale coexistence problem presents its own set of challenges, but building from a well-established body of theory may greatly improve the predictability of species persistence in competitive communities under climate change.},

Species with large seeds, long-lived leaves, or densewood have slow life histories, with mean fitness (i.e., populationgrowth rates) more strongly influenced by survival than by growth orfecundity, compared with fast life history species with small seeds,short-lived leaves, or soft wood. In contrast to measures of demographic contributions to fitness based on whole lifecycles, analysesfocusedonrawdemographic rates may underestimate the strengthof association between traits and mean fitness. Our results helpestablish the physiological basis for plant life history evolution andshow the potential for trait-based approaches in population dynamics.},

abstract = {Climate is one of the most important drivers of local adaptation in forest tree species. Standing levels of genetic diversity and structure within and among natural populations of forest trees are determined by the interplay between climatic heterogeneity and the balance between selection and gene flow. To investigate this interplay, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped in 24 to 37 populations from four subalpine conifers, Abies alba Mill., Larix decidua Mill., Pinus cembra L. and Pinus mugo Turra, across their natural ranges in the Italian Alps and Apennines. Patterns of population structure were apparent using a Bayesian clustering program, STRUCTURE, which identified three to five genetic groups per species. Geographical correlates with these patterns, however, were only apparent for P. cembra. Multivariate environmental variables [i.e. principal components (PCs)] were subsequently tested for association with SNPs using a Bayesian generalized linear mixed model. The majority of the SNPs, ranging from six in L. decidua to 18 in P. mugo, were associated with PC1, corresponding to winter precipitation and seasonal minimum temperature. In A. alba, four SNPs were associated with PC2, corresponding to the seasonal minimum temperature. Functional annotation of those genes with the orthologs in Arabidopsis revealed several genes involved in abiotic stress response. This study provides a detailed assessment of population structure and its association with environment and geography in four coniferous species in the Italian mountains.},

abstract = {This preprint has been reviewed and recommended by Peer Community In Evolutionary Biology (http://dx.doi.org/10.24072/pci.evolbiol.100034). Despite being able to conclusively demonstrate local adaptation, we are still often unable to objectively determine the climatic drivers of local adaptation. Given the rapid rate of global change, understanding the climatic drivers of local adaptation is vital. Not only will this tell us which climate axes matter most to population fitness, but such knowledge is critical to inform management strategies such as translocation and targeted gene flow. While simple assessments of geographic trait variation are useful, geographic variation (and its associations with environment) may represent plastic, rather than evolved, differences. Additionally, the vast number of trai-environment combinations makes it difficult to determine which aspects of the environment populations adapt to. Here we argue that by incorporating a measure of landscape connectivity as a proxy for gene flow, we can differentiate between trai-environment relationships underpinned by genetic differences versus those that reflect phenotypic plasticity. By doing so, we can rapidly shorten the list of trait-environment combinations that may be of adaptive significance. We demonstrate how this reasoning can be applied using data on geographic trait variation in a lizard species from Australia{\&}{\#}039;s Wet Tropics rainforest. Our analysis reveals an overwhelming signal of local adaptation for the traits and environmental variables we investigated. Our analysis also allows us to rank environmental variables by the degree to which they appear to be driving local adaptation. Although encouraging, methodological issues remain: we point to these issue in the hope that the community can rapidly hone the methods we sketch here. The promise is a rapid and general approach to identifying the environmental drivers of local adaptation.},

abstract = {Aims
Distribution and abundance patterns of species arise from the
spatiotemporal dynamics of demographic processes. Population rates of
birth, death, growth and patterns of dispersal are, in turn, influenced
by environmental conditions and biotic interactions. However, current
approaches for modelling large-scale geographical patterns often bypass
these simple premises. Centred in the mainland territory of Spain and
using Pinus halepensis as a case study, our goal was to gain insight
into the main drivers affecting local demographic processes, and how
large-scale distribution and abundance patterns are shaped by these
local variations in vital rates.
Methods
We applied the integral projection methodology to develop a spatially
explicit demographic model of tree species in mainland Spain, using
individual-level data from a national forest inventory. In our integral
projection model, environmental conditions and competitive interactions
influence the survival, growth and reproduction of trees, and we model
explicitly the dynamic colonization of new patches. With this framework,
the projected distribution and abundance patterns of P. halepensis up to
2090 were evaluated under two different climate scenarios.
Important Findings
When environmental conditions were kept constant, populations tended to
decrease in net number of adults and to increase in net basal area, thus
consisting in fewer and bigger individuals. Accounting for climate
change in our simulations exacerbated the trend in mortality, causing
widespread losses in number of trees, and few locations maintained
populations of {\textgreater}100 adult individuals per hectare. The expected increase
in mortality under climate change, on the other hand, prompted a higher
degree of regeneration via the release of niche space, although not
enough to maintain current abundance levels. Colonization spatial
patterns did not vary significantly with climatic conditions, but the
species was able to increase its distribution under climate change more
than in a constant climate scenario. Our approach yields relevant
information at different spatial scales, from plot-level processes to
large-scale abundance patterns. With it, we clearly indicate the strong
role that climate change could have in shaping future forest communities
through its differential influence on demographic processes.},

@article{Colbach2009,
abstract = {BACKGROUND, AIM AND SCOPE: Agricultural landscapes comprise cultivated fields and semi-natural areas. Biological components of these compartments such as weeds, insect pests and pathogenic fungi can disperse sometimes over very large distances, colonise new habitats via insect flight, spores, pollen or seeds and are responsible for losses in crop yield (e.g. weeds, pathogens) and biodiversity (e.g. invasive weeds). The spatiotemporal dynamics of these biological components interact with crop locations, successions and management as well as the location and management of semi-natural areas such as roadverges. The objective of this investigation was to establish a modelling and simulation methodology for describing, analysing and predicting spatiotemporal dynamics and genetics of biological components of agricultural landscapes. The ultimate aim of the models was to evaluate and propose innovative cropping systems adapted to particular agricultural concerns. The method was applied to oilseed rape (OSR) volunteers playing a key role for the coexistence of genetically modified (GM) and non-GM oilseed rape crops, where the adventitious presence of GM seeds in non-GM harvests (AGMP) could result in financial losses for farmers and cooperatives.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMATERIAL AND METHODS: A multi-year, spatially explicit model was built, using field patterns, climate, cropping systems and OSR varieties as input variables, focusing on processes and cultivation techniques crucial for plant densities and pollen flow. The sensitivity of the model to input variables was analysed to identify the major cropping factors. These should be modified first when searching for solutions limiting gene flow. The sensitivity to model processes and species life-traits were analysed to facilitate the future adaptation of the model to other species. The model was evaluated by comparing its simulations to independent field observations to determine its domain of validity and prediction error.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The cropping system study determined contrasted farm types, simulated the current situation and tested a large range of modifications compatible with each farm to identify solutions for reducing the AGMP. The landscape study simulated gene flow in a large number of actual and virtual field patterns, four combinations of regional OSR and GM proportions and three contrasted cropping systems. The analysis of the AGMP rate at the landscape level determined a maximum acceptable GM OSR area for the different cropping systems, depending on the regional OSR volunteer infestation. The analysis at the field level determined minimum distances between GM and non-GM crops, again for different cropping systems and volunteer infestations.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDISCUSSION: The main challenge in building spatially explicit models of the effects of cropping systems and landscape patterns on species dynamics and gene flow is to determine the spatial extent, the time scale, the major processes and the degree of mechanistic description to include in the model, depending on the species characteristics and the model objective.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: These models can be used to study the effects of cropping systems and landscape patterns over a large range of situations. The interactions between the two aspects make it impossible to extrapolate conclusions from individual studies to other cases. The advantage of the present method was to produce conclusions for several contrasted farm types and to establish recommendations valid for a large range of situations by testing numerous landscapes with contrasted cropping systems. Depending on the level of investigation (region or field), these recommendations concern different decision-makers, either farmers and technical advisors or cooperatives and public decision-makers.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRECOMMENDATIONS AND PERSPECTIVES: The present simulation study showed that gene flow between coexisting GM and non-GM varieties is inevitable. The management of OSR volunteers is crucial for containing gene flow, and the cropping system study identified solutions for reducing these volunteers and ferals in and outside fields. Only if these are controlled can additional measures such as isolation distances between GM and non-GM crops or limiting the proportion of the region grown with GM OSR be efficient. In addition, particular OSR varieties contribute to limit gene flow. The technical, organisational and financial feasibility of the proposed measures remains to be evaluated by a multi-disciplinary team.},

@article{Bucharova2017,
abstract = {In the context of climate change, many plant species may have problems adapting or dispersing rapidly enough to keep pace with changing environmental conditions. Given these potential problems, some experts argue against using local plant ecotypes for ecosystem restoration. Instead, they propose to use foreign ecotypes that are adapted to the predicted climate in an approach called assisted migration within species range or predictive provenancing. I argue that such actions may cause a mismatch in biotic interactions and have negative effects on other organisms.As such, assisted migration should only be considered in cases when the local ecotypes would fail to ensure ecosystem services. In fact, there is little experimental evidence on the assisted migration approach so far, and what little there is does not seem to support its use. Even in altered climates, local ecotypes mostly performed equally well or better than foreign ones selected for their adaptations to these climates. The reason is that even if adaptation to climate plays a role, this factor may be overridden by other drivers of local adaptation, such as soil or biotic interactions.Despite assisted migration being a popular concept that is repeatedly commended in scientific literature and propagated among practitioners, it should not be considered a universal tool to improve restoration outcomes during climate change.Given the lack of hard experimental data, I call for large-scale multispecies experimental studies that will provide the necessary evidence to derive general guidelines and recommendations for management of ecosystems during climate change.},

We exemplify the framework with a community of 98 fungal species sampled in ca. 22,500 dead wood units in 230 plots in 29 beech forests.

abstract = {Demography is the study of the population consequences of the fates of individuals. Individuals are differentiated on the basis of age or, in general, life cycle stages. The movement of an individual through its life cycle is a random process, and although the eventual destination (death) is certain, the pathways taken to that destination are stochastic and will differ even between identical individuals; this is individual stochasticity. A stage-classified demographic model contains implicit age-specific information, which can be analyzed using Markov chain methods. The living stages in the life cycles are transient states in an absorbing Markov chain; death is an absorbing state. This paper presents Markov chain methods for computing the mean and variance of the lifetime number of visits to any transient state, the mean and variance of longevity, the net reproductive rate R0, and the cohort generation time. It presents the matrix calculus methods needed to calculate the sensitivity and elasticity of all these indices to any life history parameters. These sensitivities have many uses, including calculation of selection gradients. It is shown that the use of R0 as a measure of fitness or an invasion exponent gives erroneous results except when R0=$\lambda$=1. The Markov chain approach is then generalized to variable environments (deterministic environmental sequences, periodic environments, iid random environments, Markovian environments). Variable environments are analyzed using the vec-permutation method to create a model that classifies individuals jointly by the stage and environmental condition. Throughout, examples are presented using the North Atlantic right whale (Eubaleana glacialis) and an endangered prairie plant (Lomatium bradshawii) in a stochastic fire environment.},

In the past, the two disciplines have addressed this question mainly with correlative approaches, despite frequent calls for more mechanistic explanations. Recent advances in computational power, theoretical understanding, and statistical tools are, however, currently facilitating the development of more system-oriented, mechanistic models. We review these models, identify different model types and theoretical frameworks, compare their processes and properties, and summarize emergent findings. We show that ecological (physiology, demographics, dispersal, biotic interactions) and evolutionary processes, as well as environmental and human-induced drivers, are increasingly modelled mechanistically; and that new insights into biodiversity dynamics emerge from these models. Yet, substantial challenges still lie ahead for this young research field. Among these, we identify scaling, calibration, validation, and balancing complexity as pressing issues. Moreover, particular process combinations are still understudied, and so far models tend to be developed for specific applications. Future work should aim at developing more flexible and modular models that not only allow different ecological theories to be expressed and contrasted, but which are also built for tight integration with all macroecological data sources. Moving the field towards such a ‘systems macroecology' will test and improve our understanding of the causal pathways through which eco-evolutionary processes create diversity patterns across spatial and temporal scales.},

abstract = {Climate and competition are often presented from two opposing views of the dominant driver of individual tree growth and species distribution in temperate forests, such as those in the eastern United States. Previous studies have provided abundant evidence indicating that both factors influence tree growth, and we argue that these effects are not independent of one another and rather that interactions between climate, competition, and size best describe tree growth. To illustrate this point, we describe the growth responses of five common eastern tree species to interacting effects of temperature, precipitation, competition, and individual size using maximum likelihood estimation. Models that explicitly include interactions among these four factors explained over half of the variance in annual growth for four out of five species using annual climate. Expanding temperature and precipitation analyses to include seasonal interactions resulted in slightly improved models with a mean R2 of 0.61 (SD 0.10). Growth responses to individual factors as well their interactions varied greatly among species. For example, growth sensitivity to temperature for Quercus rubra increased with maximum annual precipitation, but other species showed no change in sensitivity or slightly reduced annual growth. Our results also indicate that three-way interactions among individual stem size, competition, and temperature may determine which of the five co-occurring species in our study could have the highest growth rate in a given year. Continued consideration and quantification of interactions among climate, competition, and individual-based characteristics are likely to increase understanding of key biological processes such as tree growth. Greater parameterization of interactions between traditionally segregated factors such as climate and competition may also help build a framework to reconcile drivers of individual-based processes such as growth with larger-scale patterns of species distribution.},

abstract = {Seedling recruitment and survival are critical bottlenecks in tree population dynamics and are likely to play central roles in shifts in species distributions under climate change. We use data from the Forest Inventory and Analysis program to quantify the relationships between two key climate variables— mean annual temperature and growing season water deficit—and rates of seedling recruitment and sur- vival for the 50 most common tree species in the eastern United States. Our statistical models include the positive effects of conspecific adult abundance on recruitment and the potentially negative competitive effects of total canopy abundance on seedling survival. The tradeoff between these two effects creates a range from positive to negative conspecific density dependence, depending on the absolute and relative abundance of conspecific vs. heterospecific adults in a plot. Variation along the climate gradients mirrors patterns found previously in adult distributions. The clearest signal is in variation in the presence/absence of seedlings, while seedling density when present is only weakly related to local climate. The relatively narrow niche breadths for the presence of both seedlings and adults suggest that the frequency of occur- rence of species within the landscape, rather than their relative abundance when present, will show the greatest response to climate change. Our analyses predict seedling survival as a function of mean annual temperature independent of the effects of competition and water deficit and thus provide an indication of the fundamental niche for seedling distribution along the temperature gradient. For more than half of the 50 species, their realized seedling niches are displaced to warmer climates. This reflects the prevalence of species in which survival declines with increasing temperature across a significant portion of at least their southern range. Our results show that when the effects of warmer climates are taken into account, seedling survival generally increases with increasing water deficit in the generally humid climates of the eastern United States. This result is consistent with recent global surveys of the relationship between net primary productivity and forest turnover rates, but contrasts with recent studies highlighting the potential impact of drought stress on tree mortality in more arid climates.},

abstract = {Extinction debt refers to delayed species extinctions expected as a consequence of ecosystem perturbation. Quantifying such extinctions and investigating long-term consequences of perturbations has proven challenging, because perturbations are not isolated and occur across various spatial and temporal scales, from local habitat losses to global warming. Additionally, the relative importance of eco-evolutionary processes varies across scales, because levels of ecological organization, i.e. individuals, (meta)populations and (meta)communities, respond hierarchically to perturbations. To summarize our current knowledge of the scales and mechanisms influencing extinction debts, we reviewed recent empirical, theoretical and methodological studies addressing either the spatio–temporal scales of extinction debts or the eco-evolutionary mechanisms delaying extinctions. Extinction debts were detected across a range of ecosystems and taxonomic groups, with estimates ranging from 9 to 90{\%} of current species richness. The duration over which debts have been sustained varies from 5 to 570 yr, and projections of the total period required to settle a debt can extend to 1000 yr. Reported causes of delayed extinctions are 1) life-history traits that prolong individual survival, and 2) population and metapopulation dynamics that maintain populations under deteriorated conditions. Other potential factors that may extend survival time such as microevolutionary dynamics, or delayed extinctions of interaction partners, have rarely been analyzed. Therefore, we propose a roadmap for future research with three key avenues: 1) the microevolutionary dynamics of extinction processes, 2) the disjunctive loss of interacting species and 3) the impact of multiple regimes of perturbation on the payment of debts. For their ability to integrate processes occurring at different levels of ecological organization, we highlight mechanistic simulation models as tools to address these knowledge gaps and to deepen our understanding of extinction dynamics.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 British Ecological Society.Exploitation of non-timber forest products can contribute to the alleviation of poverty. However, overexploitation can also lead to species decline. Studies on the sustainability of harvest often use stationary population growth rates to assess harvesting effects. For such frequently harvested systems, transient analysis can provide new insights into the response of populations to harvest. To test the prediction that the effect of harvest differs between transient and asymptotic phases, I used four years of demographic data to compare the impact of harvesting bark and foliage on the short- and long-term dynamics of African dry zone Mahogany Khaya senegalensis in West Africa. The effect of harvest was stronger in the short term than in the long term, particularly in the moist region. Patterns of transient elasticities also differed from the elasticities of long-term growth rates to perturbation of vital rates. Survival at early life stages was more important for short-term dynamics than for long-term population dynamics. Synthesis and applications. This study illustrates that using the asymptotic growth rates to assess the impact of harvest may underestimate the short-term effects of harvest. Short-term management plans based on the elasticity analysis of long-term growth rates will be suboptimal given the relative importance of the survival of non-reproductive stages for population dynamics in the near term. Managers should use results from elasticity analysis of both long-term and short-term population dynamics to develop more realistic management plans.},

Using contemporary coexistence theory that emphasizes stabilizing niche differences and relative fitness differences, we evaluate three empirical approaches for studying community assembly. We show that experimental manipulations of the abiotic or biotic environ-ment, assessments of trait-phylogeny-environment relationships, and inves-tigations of frequency-dependent population growth all suggest strong influ-ences of stabilizing niche differences and fitness differences on the outcome of plant community assembly. Nonetheless, due to the limitations of these approaches applied in isolation, we still have a poor understanding of which niche axes and which traits determine the outcome of competition and com-munity structure. Combining current approaches represents our best chance of achieving this goal, which is fundamental to conceptual ecology and to the management of plant communities under global change.},

Yet viewed abstractly, a species' border is a geographic manifestation of a species' demographic responses to a spatially and temporally varying world. Population dynamic models provide insight into the different routes by which range limits can arise owing to gradients in demographic rates. In a metapopulation context, for example, range limits may be caused by gradients in extinction rates, colonization rates or habitat availability. We have consider invasion models in uniform and heterogeneous environments as a framework for understanding non-equilibrium range limits, and explore conditions under which invasions may cease to spread leaving behind a stationary range limit. We conclude that non-equilibrial range dynamics need further theoretical and empirical attention.},

abstract = {Aims In situ species survival involves persistence at current sites and/or colonization of new locations. Determining the likelihood of these events requires an understanding of population dynamics and dispersal. We address these issues in populations of a critically endangered tropical conifer Araucaria nemorosa and provide conservation recommendations. Location Port Boise, island of Grand Terre, New Caledonia, Pacific Ocean. Methods We characterize the demographic structure of six populations of A. nemorosa based upon size class frequencies and relative basal area compared to competing angiosperm trees. Using genotype data from 280 adult individuals at seven microsatellite loci, we indirectly estimate dispersal distances and project a maximal dispersal envelope around the extant populations. Results Our survey detected marked differences in demographic parameters including the proportion of basal area occupied by A. nemorosa versus angiosperm trees (ranging from 25{\%} to 77{\%}), the size class frequency distributions of A. nemorosa and seedling densities (ranging from 500 to 37300seedlingsha -1) among some populations. Wright's genetic neighbourhood ranged from 22 to 876 trees, and historic gene dispersal ranged from 10.8 to 82.4m, indicating that most seed dispersal is {\textless}100m. Main conclusions This study indicates that the risk of recruitment failure in remnant populations of Araucaria nemorosa is low in most of the stands but is high in the inland population For{\^{e}}t Nord. In situ natural regeneration appears to be constrained in this population, most likely as a consequence of competitive exclusion. Our results also suggest that the majority of seed dispersal is too short to allow A. nemorosa to disperse to new more hospitable sites within an ecologically relevant time-scale. Our findings have implications not only for this emblematic tree species but also for a wide range of fragmented and degraded plant species populations with limited dispersal that are vulnerable to competitive exclusion. {\textcopyright} 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Life-history theory posits that trade-offs between demographic rates constrain the range of viable life-history strategies. For coexisting tropical tree species, the best established demographic trade-off is the growth-survival trade-off. However, we know surprisingly little about co-variation of growth and survival with measures of reproduction. We analysed demographic rates from seed to adult of 282 co-occurring tropical tree and shrub species, including measures of reproduction and accounting for ontogeny. Besides the well-established fast–slow continuum, we identified a second major dimension of demographic variation: a trade-off between recruitment and seedling performance vs. growth and survival of larger individuals (≥ 1 cm dbh) corresponding to a ‘stature–recruitment' axis. The two demographic dimensions were almost perfectly aligned with two independent trait dimensions (shade tolerance and size). Our results complement recent analyses of plant life-history variation at the global scale and reveal that demographic trade-offs along multiple axes act to structure local communities.},

abstract = {Developing adaptive forest management strategies is essential to maintain the provisioning of forest goods and services (FGS) under future climate change. We assessed how climate change and forest management affect forest development and FGS for a diverse case-study landscape in Central Europe. Using a process-based forest model (LandClim) we simulated forest dynamics and FGS under a range of climate change and management scenarios in the Black Forest, Germany, which is shaped by various management practices. We focused on the interdependencies between timber production and forest diversity, the most valued FGS in this region. We found that the conversion to more drought-adapted forest types is required to prevent climate change-induced forest dieback and that this conversion must be the target of any adaptive management, especially in areas where monocultures of drought-sensitive Norway spruce (Picea abies) were promoted in the past. Forest conversion takes up to 120 years, however, with past and future adaptive management being the key drivers of timber and forest diversity provision. The conversion of drought-sensitive conifer monocultures maintains timber production in the short-term and enhances a range of forest diversity indices. Using uneven-aged forest management that targets a drought-adapted, diverse, and resilient species mixture, high species diversity can be combined with timber production in the long term. Yet, the promotion of mature-stand attributes requires management restrictions. Selecting future adaptive management options thus implies the consideration of trade-offs between forest resource use and environmental objectives, but also the exploitation of synergies between FGS that occur during forest conversion. Lastly, the large impact of past management practices on the spatial heterogeneity of forest dynamics underpins the need to assess FGS provisioning at the landscape scale.},

abstract = {The rate and distance of instantaneous pollen flow in a population are parameters of considerable current interest for plant population geneticists and conservation biologists. We have recently developed an estimator (phi ft) of differentiation between the inferred pollen clouds that fertilize several females, sampled within a single population. We have shown that there is a simple relation between phi ft and the average pollen dispersal distance (delta) for the case of a population with no geographic structure. Though forest trees usually show considerable pollen flow, assuming an absence of spatially distributed genetic structure is not always wise. Here, we develop analytical theory for the relation between phi ft and delta, for the case where the probability of Identity by Descent (IBD) for two individuals decreases with the physical distance between them. This analytical theory allows us to provide an effective method for estimating pollen dispersal distance in a population with adult genetic structure. Using real examples, we show that estimation errors can be large if genetic structure is not taken into account, so it is wise to evaluate adult genetic structure simultaneously with estimation of phi ft for the pollen clouds. We show that the results are only moderately affected by changes in the decay function, a result of some importance since no completely established theory is available for this function.},

abstract = {Quantitative estimates of the range loss of mountain plants under climate change have so far mostly relied on static geographical projections of speciesĝ habitat shifts. Here, we use a hybrid model that combines such projections with simulations of demography and seed dispersal to forecast the climate-driven spatio-temporal dynamics of 150 high-mountain plant species across the European Alps. This model predicts average range size reductions of 44ĝ€"50{\%} by the end of the twenty-first century, which is similar to projections from the most ĝ€ optimisticĝ static model (49{\%}). However, the hybrid model also indicates that population dynamics will lag behind climatic trends and that an average of 40{\%} of the range still occupied at the end of the twenty-first century will have become climatically unsuitable for the respective species, creating an extinction debt. Alarmingly, species endemic to the Alps seem to face the highest range losses. These results caution against optimistic conclusions from moderate range size reductions observed during the twenty-first century as they are likely to belie more severe longer-term effects of climate warming on mountain plants. {\textcopyright} 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {Dynamic population models typically aim to predict demography and the resulting population dynamics in relation to environmental variation. However, they rarely include the diversity of individual responses to environmental changes, thus hampering our understanding of demographic mechanisms. We develop an integrated integral projection model (IPM2) that is a combination of an integrated population model (IPMpop) and an integral projection model (IPMind). IPM2 includes interactions between environmental and individual effects on demographic rates and can forecast both population size and individual trait distributions. First, we study the performance of this model using eight simulated scenarios with variable reproductive selective pressures on an individual trait. When the individual trait interacts with the environmental variable and the selective pressure on the individual trait is non‐linear, only IPM2 produces adequate predictions, because IPMind does not link predictions between the population level and observed data and because IPMpop does not include the individual trait. Second, we apply IPM2 to a population of barn swallows. The model accurately predicts trends of the barn swallow population while also providing mechanistic insights. High precipitation negatively influenced population dynamics through delaying laying dates, which lowered reproductive and survival rates. To predict the future of populations, we need to understand their individual drivers and thus include individual responses to their environment while following the entire population. As a consequence, IPM2 will improve our ability to test ecological and evolutionary hypotheses and improve the accuracy of population forecasting to aid management programs.},

abstract = {The future of temperate forests in the face of global change and anthropogenic stressors remains uncertain. The regeneration stage, which is a critical bottleneck for many organisms, is a key indicator of forest health, future canopy composition and forest adaptive capacity. In trees, seemingly healthy forests can be at long-term risk due to insufficient juveniles to replace them (regeneration failure), or compositional differences between juveniles and adults (regeneration mismatch). We propose ‘regeneration debt' to collectively describe regeneration failure and mismatch in analogy to extinction debt. To demonstrate this concept, we conducted a macroecological analysis of regeneration debt and anthropogenic stressors in eastern US forests. Using U.S. Forest Service-Forest Inventory and Analysis data, we quantified regeneration debt in 18 states from Maine to South Carolina, and evaluated the influence of site, anthropogenic stressors and climate drivers in the most affected regions. We identified three distinct regions, with little debt in the north, moderate debt in the south and severe regeneration debt in the central, mid-Atlantic region. In this region, multiple anthropogenic stressors (invasive plants, deer overabundance and land use) were associated with both low-regeneration abundance and the prevalence of disease-prone and/or suboptimal species. Synthesis and applications. Without management intervention, the severe regeneration debt in the mid-Atlantic region will likely lead to long-term declines in forest cover, with cascading negative effects on forest-dependent taxa and ecosystem services. Moreover, the location of the regeneration debt, which is at the northern edge of and involves many of the tree species that are predicted to gain suitable habitat in the Northeastern US, has consequences that extend far beyond its current geographic extent. In fact, this regeneration debt may already be functioning as a barrier to poleward tree migration. Our results demonstrate the value of regeneration debt as an indicator of ecosystem health and forest adaptive capacity.},

abstract = {As global temperatures rise, variation in annual climate is also changing, with unknown consequences for forest biomes. Growing forests have the ability to capture atmospheric CO2 and thereby slow rising CO2 concentrations. Forests' ongoing ability to sequester C depends on how tree communities respond to changes in climate variation. Much of what we know about tree and forest response to climate variation comes from tree-ring records. Yet typical tree-ring datasets and models do not capture the diversity of climate responses that exist within and among trees and species. We address this issue using a model that estimates individual tree response to climate variables while accounting for variation in individuals' size, age, competitive status, and spatially structured latent covariates. Our model allows for inference about variance within and among species. We quantify how variables influence aboveground biomass growth of individual trees from a representative sample of 15 northern or southern tree species growing in a transition zone between boreal and temperate biomes. Individual trees varied in their growth response to fluctuating mean annual temperature and summer moisture stress. The variation among individuals within a species was wider than mean differences among species. The effects of mean temperature and summer moisture stress interacted, such that warm years produced positive responses to summer moisture availability and cool years produced negative responses. As climate models project significant increases in annual temperatures, growth of species like Acer saccharum, Quercus rubra, and Picea glauca will vary more in response to summer moisture stress than in the past. The magnitude of biomass growth variation in response to annual climate was 92-95{\%} smaller than responses to tree size and age. This means that measuring or predicting the physical structure of current and future forests could tell us more about future C dynamics than growth responses related to climate change alone.},

abstract = {The protection of rare arable weeds and the restoration of biodiversity in agroecosystems have become an important issue in most European countries. Traditional analyses of weed dispersal focussing on the prediction and control of infestations have to be adapted to the new aim of restoration ecology by quantifying chances of re-colonisation within fields and across field borders. This study analyses within-field spread of weeds under usual arable cultivation whereas between-field colonisation usually not aided by machinery was simulated in undisturbed controls. The experiments were conducted on an arable farm in the central German lowlands 6 years after conversion to organic management. The test species, Lithospermum arvense and Silene noctiflora, have declined in recent decades but belong to the characteristic weed community. Dispersal was analysed by recording seedling emergence around patches of introduced mother plants where the species were absent. Negative exponential models provided a good fit of the dispersal curves from the mode outward. In the "arable" treatment, the percentage seedlings - distance regression line fell below 0.5{\%} at 5 m, in the control this level was reached at a distance of about 2 m indicating that long-distance dispersal is a rare event. Cultivation increased the peak distance of the dispersal curves significantly whereas the slope of the curves from the mode outward was hardly affected. Despite different fruit and propagule morphology, seed shadows of both species were very similar. Spatial distribution of the seedlings in the arable treatment occurred along the axis of management and against the prevailing wind direction. The results may help to improve targeting subsidies in agri-environment schemes and assessing the need for re-introduction by sowing. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Statistical modeling of areas of distribution of species by correlative analysis of the environmental features of known presences has become widespread. However, to a large degree, the logic and the functioning of many of these applications remain obscure, not only due to the fact that some of the modeling methods are intrinsically complex (neural networks, genetic algorithms, generalized additive models, for example), but mainly because the role of other ecological processes affecting the species distributions sometimes is not explicitly stated. Resorting to fundamental principles of population ecology, a scheme of analysis based on separation of three factors affecting species distributions (environment, biotic interactions and movements) is used to clarify some results of niche modeling exercises. The area of distribution of a virtual species which was generated by both environmental and biotic factors serves to illustrate the possibility that, at coarse resolutions, the distribution can be approximately recovered using only information about the environmental factors and ignoring the biotic interactions. Finally, information on the distribution of a butterfly species, Baronia brevicornis, is used to illustrate the importance of interpreting the results of niche models by including hypothesis about one class of movements. The results clarify the roles of the three factors in interpreting the results of using correlative approaches to modeling species distributions or their niches},

abstract = {The logging of large trees in tropical forests causes a decrease in the density of reproductive individuals, which likely affects the pattern of pollen dispersal and the mating system of the remaining trees in the population. Here, we investigate the impact of logging on mating system and genetic diversity of the low-density, thrip-pollinated, dioecious tree Bagassa guianensis within a 500-ha plot at Tapaj{\'{o}}s National Forest, Par{\'{a}} State, Brazil. Mating system parameters of the logged population were estimated using mixed-mating model. Six microsatellite loci were used to genotype 232 seeds from ten remnant female trees over three seasons (2006, 2007, and 2008). The data were compared with the mating system of the unlogged population of B. guianensis (18 female trees, 488 seeds) in the same plot. The overall number of alleles found in the open-pollinated progenies decreased after logging (K = 71 before logging and K = 57 after logging, considering the three after logging seasons pooled), as well as the average number of alleles per locus (A = 11.8 and 9.5, respectively). Similarly, the number of private alleles, which is defined in the context of this study as the number of alleles observed in the population exclusively before or after logging, also decreased after logging (15 and 1, respectively). However, the average number of alleles per locus and the observed and expected heterozygosities were not significantly higher before logging than after logging. Logging also did not affect the inbreeding of progenies in the population. Somewhat unexpectedly, the effective number of pollen donors was consistently higher after (N{\textless}inf{\textgreater}ep{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} = 14.5 in 2006, 8.1 in 2007, and 6.3 in 2008) than before logging (N{\textless}inf{\textgreater}ep{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} = 3.4), suggesting that the loss of alleles in the population was compensated by the higher heterogeneity in the pollen pool after the removal of the largest trees by logging. Potential causes explaining the patterns found here include the maintenance of large patches of forest around the logged plot and the species' ability to perform long-distance pollination by airborne thrips. Maintenance of landscape integrity as logged and unlogged forests around the exploited areas is recommended to enhance pollen migration and to avoid long-term losses in genetic diversity.},

To further investigate the effect of speciation on neutral biodiversity, we analyze a spatially explicit neutral model based on population genetics.

We find that with realistic mutation rates, our metacommunity model driven by neutral processes cannot support more than a few species. Adding natural selection in the population genetics of speciation increases the number of species in the metacommunity, but the level of diversity found in the Barro Colorado Island is difficult to reach.},

abstract = {Abstract. Strong global demand for tropical timber and agricultural products has driven large-scale logging and subsequent conversion of tropical forests. Given that the majority of tropical landscapes have been or will likely be logged, the protection ofbiodiversity within tropical forests thus depends on whether species can persist in these economically exploited lands, and if species cannot persist, whether we can protect enough primary forest from logging and conversion. However, our knowledge of the impact of logging and conversion on biodiversity is limited to a few taxa, often sampled in different locations with complex land-use histories, hampering attempts to plan cost-effective conservation strategies and to draw conclusions across taxa. Spanning a land-use gradient of primary forest, once- and twice-logged forests, and oil palm plantations, we used traditional sampling andDNAmetabarcoding to compile an extensive data set inSabah,MalaysianBorneofornine vertebrate andinvertebrate taxa toquantify thebiological impacts of logging and oil palm, develop cost-effective methods of protecting biodiversity, and examinewhether there is congruence inresponse among taxa.Logged forests retained high species richness, including, on average, 70{\%}of species found in primary forest. In contrast, conversion to oil palmdramatically reduces species richness, with significantly fewer primary-forest species than foundonloggedforest transects for seventaxa.Usinga systematic conservationplanning analysis, we show that efficient protection of primary-forest species is achieved with land portfolios that include a large proportion of logged-forest plots. Protecting logged forests is thus a cost-effective method of protecting an ecologically and taxonomically diverse range of species, particularly when conservation budgets are limited. Six indicator groups (birds, leaf-litter ants, beetles, aerial hymenopterans, flies, and true bugs) proved to be consistently good predictors of the response of the other taxa to logging and oil palm. Our results confidently establish the high conservation value of logged forests and the low value of oil palm. Cross-taxon congruence in responses to disturbance also suggests that the practice of focusing on key indicator taxa yields important information of general biodiversity in studies of logging and oil palm.},

abstract = {testing for the statistical significance of com- ponent tests is routinely carried out in a biased fashion that liberally judges far too many tests to be significant The standard Bonferroni technique is described in many general statistics texts. It can be readily shown (e.g., see Miller, 1981) that, if a collection of k tests is simultaneously carried out at the a/k significance level, the probability, on H0,c that at least one component H0,i will be erroneously rejected is less than or equal to a. This inequality does not require that component tests be independent. A major disadvantage of the stan- dard Bonferroni method, however, occurs when more than one component H0,i is false. For example, suppose in the hypothetical correlation table described above that four of the ten correlations were actually different from zero. The standard Bonferroni test has substantially reduced power in detecting more than one false H0,i (see Holm, 1979). To increase power in detecting more than one false Ho0, Holm ( 1979) introduced the sequential Bonferroni technique. To begin the test, select a significance level (a). Next, replace each test statistic by its corresponding P value and rank the P values from smallest (P,) to largest (Pk). First consider the smallest P value (PI). If P, =/{\textless} a/k, then judge that the corresponding test in- dicates significance at the "table-wide" a level; if the inequality is not met, declare that all tests indicate nonsignificance at the table-wide a level. If and only if P, c? a/k, proceed to the second smallest P value (P2). If P2 '? a/(k - 1), then judge this test also to indicate statistical significance at the a table-wide level of significance and proceed to the third smallest P value (P3). If P2 {\textgreater} a/(k - 1), then declare the corresponding test and all other tests with larger P values to indicate nonsignificance at the table-wide a level. Continue in this fashion until the inequality P, c? a/(I + k - i) is not met.},

abstract = {Kalmia angustifolia is an ericaceous shrub that can rapidly spread on recently harvested boreal forest sites, causing a slow-down in soil nutrient cycling and reduced growth of spruce seedlings. It has been hypothesized that tannins released from Kalmia litter suppress soil enzyme activity, and are thus important in controlling ecosystem structure and processes. Here the effects of different concentrations of tannins extracted from both Kalmia and black spruce (Picea mariana) foliage were tested on enzyme activities of soil extracts. Then the effects of various Kalmia-black spruce litter mixtures on soil enzyme activity were investigated. Lastly, the correlation between Kalmia cover in the field and soil enzyme activity was measured. Both tannin types suppressed beta-glucosidase and acid phosphatase activities, and the magnitude of these effects was concentration-dependent. beta-glucosidase and amidase activity decreased linearly with an increasing Kalmia : spruce litter ratio added to soil. A field survey of 24 sites revealed a negative relationship between percentage Kalmia cover and beta-glucosidase activity. Collectively, results of the three experiments converge to support the claim that enzyme inhibition by litter tannins has evolved as an important mechanism controlling ecosystem processes and structure following Kalmia invasion on recently disturbed forest sites.},

abstract = {Drought events are increasing globally, and reports of consequent forest mortality are widespread. However, due to a lack of a quantitative global synthesis, it is still not clear whether drought-induced mortality rates differ among global biomes and whether functional traits influence the risk of drought-induced mortality. To address these uncertainties, we performed a global meta-analysis of 58 studies of drought-induced forest mortality. Mortality rates were modelled as a function of drought, temperature, biomes, phylogenetic and functional groups and functional traits. We identified a consistent global-scale response, where mortality increased with drought severity [log mortality (trees trees−1 year−1) increased 0.46 (95{\%} CI = 0.2–0.7) with one SPEI unit drought intensity]. We found no significant differences in the magnitude of the response depending on forest biomes or between angiosperms and gymnosperms or evergreen and deciduous tree species. Functional traits explained some of the variation in drought responses between species (i.e. increased from 30 to 37{\%} when wood density and specific leaf area were included). Tree species with denser wood and lower specific leaf area showed lower mortality responses. Our results illustrate the value of functional traits for understanding patterns of drought-induced tree mortality and suggest that mortality could become increasingly widespread in the future.},

abstract = {Species range limits involve many aspects of evolution and ecology, from species distribution and abundance to the evolution of niches. Theory sug-gests myriad processes by which range limits arise, including competitive exclusion, Allee effects, and gene swamping; however, most models remain empirically untested. Range limits are correlated with a number of abiotic and biotic factors, but further experimentation is needed to understand un-derlying mechanisms. Range edges are characterized by increased genetic isolation, genetic differentiation, and variability in individual and population performance, but evidence for decreased abundance and fitness is lacking. Evolution of range limits is understudied in natural systems; in particular, the role of gene flow in shaping range limits is unknown. Biological invasions and rapid distribution shifts caused by climate change represent large-scale experiments on the underlying dynamics of range limits. A better fusion of experimentation and theory will advance our understanding of the causes of range limits. 415},

However, empirical support for decreasing pop-ulation abundance with increasing distance from geographic range or climatic niche centre (distance–abundance relationships) remains fairly weak. We examine over 1400 bird, mammal, fish and tree species to provide a thorough test of distance–abundance relationships, and their associa-tions with species traits and phylogenetic relationships. We failed to detect consistent distance– abundance relationships, and found no association between distance–abundance slope and species traits or phylogenetic relatedness. Together, our analyses suggest that distance–abundance relation-ships may be rare, difficult to detect, or are an oversimplification of the complex biogeographical forces that determine species spatial abundance patterns.},

abstract = {Assisted migration of warm-adapted genotypes to currently cooler climates may reduce maladaptation from future climate change. Few assisted migration trials have considered limitations of the cooler climates and pathogens currently present at transplant sites. This is especially important to consider in riparian ecosystems that are priority targets for restoration in the western United States as they harbor diverse communities. In an effort to validate assisted migration as an effective strategy for mediating the negative impacts of climate change, we used a provenance trial with replicated genotypes from 19 populations of the foundation riparian tree species, Fremont cottonwood (Populus fremontii), transplanted to a cold site to test for genetic variation in growth, mortality, and resistance to shoot blight fungi (Venturia sp.). Populations from cool sites had up to 4 times faster growth, 3 times higher survival, and 8 times higher resistance to Venturia than populations from warm sites, providing evidence of local adaptation to both climate and pathogenic fungi. Budburst phenology and shoot blight were correlated with frost damage, subsequent shrub-form architecture, and mortality. While climate change models predict 6°C increases, plants transferred distances of 6°C at this time would not perform well; an intermediate transfer distance of less than 3°C would avoid maladaptation to the current environment during assisted migration. Thus, multiple and intermediate transfer phases to supplement local genetic variation will likely be necessary for effective assisted migration to accommodate current environments and large changes in climate.},

Here, epi-benthic megafauna was sampled at 755 stations in the Lower Estuary and Northern Gulf of St. Lawrence (EGSL) each summer between 2006 and 2009. We combined various types of multivariate analyses to 1) describe the structure and spatial distribution of benthic communities, 2) analyse the relationship between these communities and environmental parameters, and subsequently 3) build a community distribution model to predict the spatial distribution of the communities, creating community distribution maps covering the entire area to be used for marine management and conservation. We identified distinct benthic communities in the study area that closely correlate with the 200. m depth contour and with major environmental variables. A redundancy analysis revealed that communities were associated with depth, oxygen saturation, temperature, bottom current, seabed uniformity, distance to coast and type of sediment. Together these environmental descriptors explained 38{\%} of the variation in megafaunal community composition. The environmental variables were used to build a community distribution model using generalized linear models to predict high and low suitability zones of each community in the EGSL. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Analyses of fine-scale and macrogeographic genetic structure in plant populations provide an initial indication of how gene flow, natural selection, and genetic drift may collectively influence the distribution of genetic variation. The objective of our study is to evaluate the spatial dispersion of alleles within and among subpopulations of a tropical shrub, Psychotria officinalis (Rubiaceae), in a lowland wet forest in Costa Rica. This insect-pollinated, self-incompatible understory plant is dispersed primarily by birds, some species of which drop the seeds immediately while others transport seeds away from the parent plant. Thus, pollination should promote gene flow while at least one type of seed dispersal agent might restrict gene flow. Sampling from five subpopulations in undisturbed wet forest at Estacion Biologica La Selva, Costa Rica, we used electrophoretically detected isozyme markers to examine the spatial scale of genetic structure. Our goals are: 1) describe genetic diversity of each of the five subpopulations of Psychotria officinalis sampled within a contiguous wet tropical forest; 2) evaluate fine-scale genetic structure of adults of P. officinalis within a single 2.25-ha mapped plot; and 3) estimate genetic structure of P. officinalis using data from five subpopulations located up to 2 km apart. Using estimates of coancestry, statistical analyses reveal significant positive genetic correlations between individuals on a scale of 5 m but no significant genetic relatedness beyond that interplant distance within the studied subpopulation. Multilocus estimates of genetic differentiation among subpopulations were low, but significant (Fst = 0.095). Significant Fst estimates were largely attributable to a single locus (Lap-2). Thus, multilocus estimates of Fst may be influenced by microgeographic selection. If true, then the observed levels of IBD may be overestimates.},

For example, plant seeds that appear to be adapted for wind dispersal may occasionally be dispersed long distances by birds, or vice versa. In this paper, we explore whether existing data on dispersal distances, colonization rates, and migration rates support the idea that dispersal processes suggested by the morphology of the dispersal unit are responsible for long distance dispersal. We conclude that the relationship between morphologically defined dispersal syndrome and long-distance dispersal is poor. This relationship is poor because the relationship between the morphology of dispersal units and the multiple processes that move seeds are often complex.

abstract = {QuestionQuantification of the effect of species traits on the assembly of communities is challenging from a statistical point of view. A key question is how species occurrence and abundance can be explained by the trait values of the species and the environmental values at the sites. MethodsUsing a sitesxspecies abundance table, a sitexenvironment data table and a speciesxtrait data table, we address the above question using a novel generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) approach. The GLMM overcomes problems of pseudo-replication and heteroscedastic variance by including sites and species as random factors. The method is equally applicable to presence-absence data as to count and multinomial data. We present a tiered forward selection approach for obtaining a parsimonious model and compare the results with alternative methods (the fourth corner method and RLQ ordination). ResultsWe illustrate the approach on a presence-absence version on two data sets. In the Dune Meadow data, species presence is parsimoniously explained by moisture and manure on the meadows in combination with seed mass and specific leaf area (SLA). In the Grazed Grassland data, species presence is parsimoniously explained by the grazing intensity and soil phosphorus in combination with the C:N ratio and flowering mode. ConclusionsOur GLMM approach can be used to identify which species traits and environmental variables best explain the species distribution, and which traits are significantly correlated with environmental variables. We argue that the method is better suited for providing an interpretable and predictive model than the fourth corner method and RLQ.},

However, a missed component of biodiversity loss that often accompanies or even precedes species disappearance is the extinction of ecological interactions. Here, we propose a novel model that (i) relates the diversity of both species and interactions along a gradient of environmental deterioration and (ii) explores how the rate of loss of ecological functions, and consequently of ecosystem services, can be accelerated or restrained depending on how the rate of species loss covaries with the rate of interactions loss. We find that the loss of species and interactions are decoupled, such that ecological interactions are often lost at a higher rate. This implies that the loss of ecological interactions may occur well before species disappearance, affecting species functionality and ecosystems services at a faster rate than species extinctions. We provide a number of empirical case studies illustrating these points. Our approach emphasizes the importance of focusing on species interactions as the major biodiversity component from which the 'health' of ecosystems depends.},

abstract = {Aim: The rate and magnitude of climate-induced tree range shifts may be influenced by range-wide variation in recruitment, which acts as a bottleneck in tree range dynamics. Here, we compare range predictions made using standard species distribution models (SDMs) and an integrated metamodelling approach that assimilates data on adult occurrence, seedling recruitment dynamics, and seedling survival under both current and future climate, and evaluate the degree to which information provided by seedling data can improve predictions of range dynamics. Location: The interior west region of the United States. Time period: 1990–2015. Major taxa studied: Five widespread conifer tree species. Methods: We used a previously published metamodelling framework to combine information from SDMs of adult tree occurrence and sub-models describing seedling recruitment dynamics and seedling survival into a single set of predictions for the probability of occurrence for each species. The integrated framework links sub-models to a SDM to generate cohesive predictions that consider information and uncertainty contained in all datasets. We then compared predictions from the integrated model to SDM predictions. Results: Integration of seedling information served primarily to improve characterization of model uncertainty, particularly in regions where recruitment may be limited by temperatures that exceed seedling tolerance. Integration constrained response curves very slightly across most climate gradients, particularly across temperature gradients. These differences were primarily attributable to the isolated effects of temperature on seedling survival and not to recruitment dynamics. Main conclusions: Our results indicate that range-wide variation in recruitment both now and in the future is most uncertain along the edges of occupied regions, which increases uncertainty in projections of future species occurrence along range margins. Overall, the broad-scale climatic dependence of the regeneration niche appears weaker than that of the adult climatic niche, and this enhances uncertainty in predicting range-wide responses of these species to climate change.},

To answer these questions, we systematically searched the scientific literature to identify all original research studies that assess seed transported by cars and listed the species with seed on/in cars. From the 13 studies that fit these criteria, we found 626 species from 75 families that have seed that can be dispersed by cars. Of these, 599 are listed as weeds in some part of the world, with 439 listed as invasive or naturalized alien species in one or more European countries, 248 are invasive/noxious weeds in North America, 370 are naturalized alien species in Australia, 167 are alien species in India, 77 are invasive species in China and 23 are declared weeds/invaders in South Africa. One hundred and one are classified as internationally important environmental weeds. Although most (487) were only recorded once, some species such as Chenopodium album, Poa pratensis and Trifolium repens were common among studies. Perennial graminoids seem to be favoured over annual graminoids while annual forbs are favoured over perennial forbs. Species characteristics including seed size and morphology and where the plants grew affected the probability that their seed was transported by cars. Seeds can be found in many different places on cars including under the chassis, front and rear bumpers, wheel wells and rims, front and back mudguards, wheel arches, tyres and on interior floor mats. With increasing numbers of cars and expanding road networks in many regions, these results highlight the importance of cars as a dispersal mechanism, and how it may favour invasions by some species over others. Strategies to reduce the risk of seed dispersal by cars include reducing seed on cars by mowing road verges and cleaning cars.},

abstract = {Humans are known for their capacity to disperse organisms long distances. Long-distance dispersal can be important for species threatened by habitat destruction, but research into human-mediated dispersal is often focused upon few and/or invasive species. Here we use citizen science to identify the capacity for humans to disperse seeds on their clothes and footwear from a known species pool in a valuable habitat, allowing for an assessment of the fraction and types of species dispersed by humans in an alternative context. We collected material from volunteers cutting 48 species-rich meadows throughout Sweden. We counted 24,354 seeds of 197 species, representing 34{\%} of the available species pool, including several rare and protected species. However, 71 species (36{\%}) are considered invasive elsewhere in the world. Trait analysis showed that seeds with hooks or other appendages were more likely to be dispersed by humans, as well as those with a persistent seed bank. More activity in a meadow resulted in more dispersal, both in terms of species and representation of the source communities. Average potential dispersal distances were measured at 13 km. We consider humans capable seed dispersers, transporting a significant proportion of the plant communities in which they are active, just like more traditional vectors such as livestock. When rural populations were larger, people might have been regular and effective seed dispersers, and the net rural-urban migration resulting in a reduction in humans in the landscape may have exacerbated the dispersal failure evident in declining plant populations today. With the fragmentation of habitat and changes in land use resulting from agricultural change, and the increased mobility of humans worldwide, the dispersal role of humans may have shifted from providers of regular local and landscape dispersal to providers of much rarer long-distance and regional dispersal, and international invasion.},

abstract = {The Siberian stone pine (Pinus sibirica Du Tour) is one of the main forest-forming coniferous species of the boreal ecosystems of Western Siberia. We used the isozyme method to analyze 11 ecotypes representing the latitudinal and longitudinal profiles within the species range, including samples from the geographic boundaries of the distribution. The genetic structure of the ecotypes is described on the basis of the variability for 26 isozyme loci encoding for 16 enzyme systems. The greatest genetic diversity was observed in the taiga ecotypes in the central part of the studied area, while the ecotypes along the species range boundaries were shown to be genetically depauperized. Approximately 8.1 {\%} of the observed genetic diversity is attributed to differences between the studied ecotypes. We detected high levels of genetic diversity for the Fest-2, Pgm-1, Sod-4, and a few other loci, as well as a correlation between allele frequencies and geographical locations of the populations. The results of multivariate analysis of allelic frequencies as well as cluster analysis allowed us to discriminate three major groups of ecotypes: north-eastern, central and south-western. In view of our results, we compare two hypotheses: one which attributes the spatial distribution of genetic variations to the selectivity for some of the polymorphic allozyme loci, and the other based in the history of the formation of the range of the Siberian stone pine. {\textcopyright} 2014 Pleiades Publishing, Inc.},

abstract = {The redistribution of life on Earth has emerged as one of the most significant biological responses to anthropogenic climate warming(1-3). Despite being one of the most long-standing puzzles in ecology(4), we still have little understanding of how temperature sets geographic range boundaries(5). Here we show that marine and terrestrial ectotherms differ in the degree to which they fill their potential latitudinal ranges, as predicted from their thermal tolerance limits. Marine ectotherms more fully occupy the extent of latitudes tolerable within their thermal tolerance limits, and are consequently predicted to expand at their poleward range boundaries and contract at their equatorward boundaries with climate warming. In contrast, terrestrial ectotherms are excluded from the warmest regions of their latitudinal range; thus, the equatorward, or 'trailing' range boundaries, may not shift consistently towards the poles with climate warming. Using global observations of climate-induced range shifts, we test this prediction and show that in the ocean, shifts at both range boundaries have been equally responsive, whereas on land, equatorward range boundaries have lagged in response to climate warming. These results indicate that marine species' ranges conform more closely to their limits of thermal tolerance, and thus range shifts will be more predictable and coherent. However, on land, warmer range boundaries are not at equilibrium with heat tolerance. Understanding the relative contribution of factors other than temperature in controlling equatorward range limits is critical for predicting distribution changes, with implications for population and community viability.},

abstract = {To persist, species are expected to shift their geographical ranges polewards or to higher elevations as the Earth's climate warms. However, although many species' ranges have shifted in historical times, many others have not, or have shifted only at the high-latitude or high-elevation limits, leading to range expansions rather than contractions. Given these idiosyncratic responses to climate warming, and their varied implications for species' vulnerability to climate change, a critical task is to understand why some species have not shifted their ranges, particularly at the equatorial or low-elevation limits, and whether such resilience will last as warming continues. Here we show that compensatory changes in demographic rates are buffering southern populations of two North American tundra plants against the negative effects of a warming climate, slowing their northward range shifts, but that this buffering is unlikely to continue indefinitely. Southern populations of both species showed lower survival and recruitment but higher growth of individual plants, possibly owing to longer, warmer growing seasons. Because of these and other compensatory changes, the population growth rates of southern populations are not at present lower than those of northern ones. However, continued warming may yet prove detrimental, as most demographic rates that improved in moderately warmer years declined in the warmest years, with the potential to drive future population declines. Our results emphasize the need for long-term, range-wide measurement of all population processes to detect demographic compensation and to identify nonlinear responses that may lead to sudden range shifts as climatic tipping points are exceeded.},

abstract = {Pollen flow is a key biological process that connects plant populations, preventing genetic impoverishment and inbreeding. Pollen-mediated long-distance dispersal (LDD) events are especially important for plant species in increasingly fragmented landscapes. Patterns of pollen dispersal were directly estimated and dispersal kernels modelled in an experimental population of Ranunculus bulbosus and Trifolium montanum to determine the potential for LDD. Eight and 11 microsatellite markers were used for R. bulbosus and T. montanum, respectively, to run a likelihood-based paternity analysis on randomly chosen offspring (Ntotal = 180 per species) from five maternal plants. High rates of selfing were found in R. bulbosus (average 45.7{\%}), while no selfing was observed in T. montanum. The majority (60{\%}) of mating events occurred at very short distances: the median of the observed dispersal distances was 0.8 m in both species, and the average distances were 15.9 and 10.3 m in R. bulbosus and T. montanum, respectively. Modelling the pollen dispersal kernel with four different distribution functions (exponential-power, geometric, 2Dt and Weibull) indicated that the best fit for both species was given by a Weibull function. Yet, the tail of the T. montanum pollen dispersal kernel was thinner than in R. bulbosus, suggesting that the probability for LDD is higher in the latter species. Even though the majority of pollen dispersal occurred across short distances, the detection of several mating events up to 362 m (R. bulbosus) and 324 m (T. montanum) suggests that pollen flow may be sufficient to ensure population connectivity in these herb species across fragmented grasslands in Swiss agricultural landscapes.},

It helps understand the species-area relationship, a fundamental pattern in ecology and an essential tool for conservation. The classic TIB does not, however, account for the complex structure of ecological systems. We extend the TIB to take into account trophic interactions and derive a species-specific model for occurrence probability. We find that the properties of the regional food web influence the species-area relationship, and that, in return, immigration and extinction dynamics affect local food web properties. We compare the accuracy of the classic TIB to our trophic TIB to predict community composition of real food webs and find strong support for our trophic extension of the TIB. Our approach provides a parsimonious explanation to species distributions and open new perspectives to integrate the complexity of ecological interactions into simple species distribution models.},

abstract = {Integral Projection Models (IPMs) use information on how an individual's state influences its vital rates - survival, growth and reproduction - to make population projections. IPMs are constructed from regression models predicting vital rates from state variables (e.g., size or age) and covariates (e.g., environment). By combining regressions of vital rates, an IPM provides mechanistic insight into emergent ecological patterns such as population dynamics, species geographic distributions, or life history strategies. Here, we review important resources for building IPMs and provide a comprehensive guide, with extensive R code, for their construction. IPMs can be applied to any stage-structured population; here we illustrate IPMs for a series of plant life histories of increasing complexity and biological realism, highlighting the utility of various regression methods for capturing biological patterns. We also present case studies illustrating how IPMs can be used to predict species' geographic distributions and life history strategies. IPMs can represent a wide range of life histories at any desired level of biological detail. Much of the strength of IPMs lies in the strength of regression models. Many subtleties arise when scaling from vital rate regressions to population-level patterns, so we provide a set of diagnostics and guidelines to ensure that models are biologically plausible. Moreover, IPMs can exploit a large existing suite of analytical tools developed for Matrix Projection Models.},

abstract = {Conifers are among the most genetically diverse plants but show the lowest levels of genetic differentiation, even among geographically distant populations. High gene flow among populations may be one of the most important factors in maintaining these genetic patterns. Here, we provide empirical evidence for extensive pollen-mediated gene dispersal between natural stands of a widespread northern temperate/boreal conifer, Picea glauca. We used 6 polymorphic allozyme loci to quantify the proportion of seeds sired by pollen originating from different sources in a landscape fragmented by agriculture in North Central Ontario, Canada. In 7 stands, a small proportion of seeds were sired by self-pollen or neighboring trees but 87.1{\%} (±1.7{\%} standard error [SE]) of seeds were sired by pollen from at least 250 to 3000 m away. In 4 single isolated trees, self-fertilization rates were low and more than 96{\%} (±1.3{\%} SE) of seeds were sired by immigrant pollen. The average minimum pollen dispersal distance in outcrossed matings was 619 m. These results provide strong evidence that extensive long-distance pollen dispersal plays a primary role in maintaining low genetic differentiation among natural populations of P. glauca and helps maintain genetic diversity and minimize inbreeding in small stands in a fragmented landscape. {\textcopyright} The American Genetic Association. 2007.

abstract = {We repeated bird and vegetation surveys in 1991–1992 and 2005–2006 among young managed stands and old-growth forests in southeast Alaska to evaluate whether pre-commercial thinning of managed stands influenced the bird community. We compared decadal changes in bird densities and forest vegetation among 3 stand types: managed stands originating from clearcuts 35 years ago that were left untreated (unthinned), managed stands thinned at uniform spacing (thinned), and old growth with no prior timber harvest. We did not detect differences in decadal trends in avian densities between thinned and unthinned stands for 15 of 16 common bird species using a repeated-measures design. Thinning did not result in greater recruitment of overstory-nesting species as predicted. This was likely because of 1) similar increases in tree heights (x ¼ 9–10 m) and canopy cover (x ¼ 30–42{\%}) between unthinned and thinned stands across decades and 2) the relatively young successional stage of these stands, which had only begun to recruit medium and large size conifers (dbh  36 cm). Decadal trends in densities of most (88{\%}) understory- nesting bird species did not differ between thinned and unthinned stands. Shrub cover decreased by 22{\%} and 31{\%} across decades in thinned and unthinned stands, respectively. Bird community composition in managed stands reflected the general decadal changes in forest vegetation with a shift in dominance from understory species in the early 1990s (80–85{\%} of total bird density) to an equal abundance of understory (45–54{\%}) and overstory species in the mid-2000s. The latter was more similar to old-growth stands, which were dominated by overstory species (67–71{\%}). Overstory-nesting birds in old growth increased in density by 49{\%} across decades. Densities of cavity-nesting species remained unchanged in managed stands and less than densities in old growth across decades, possibly because of a lack of large trees and snags for nest sites. Overall, thinning of clearcut stands, the primary silvicultural system in the region, had few measurable benefits to birds nearly 20 years after treatment. Monitoring over the 70–100-year harvest rotation may be necessary to fully test whether thinning accelerates succession of bird communities in clearcut stands. However, partial harvests that retain large trees and snags should also be explored as alternatives to better maintain late-succession avifauna throughout the harvest rotation in southeast Alaska.},

abstract = {Although observations of species-rich communities have long served as a pri- mary motivation for research on the coexistence of competitors, the majority of our empirical and theoretical understanding comes from two-species systems. How much of the coexistence observed in species-rich communities results from indirect effects among competitors that only emerge in diverse systems remains poorly understood. Resolving this issue requires simple, scalable, and intuitive metrics for quantifying the conditions for coexistence in multispecies systems, and how these conditions differ from those expected based solely on pairwise interac- tions. To achieve these aims, we develop a structural approach for studying the set of parame- ter values compatible with n-species coexistence given the geometric constraints imposed by the matrix of competition coefficients. We derive novel mathematical metrics analogous to stabilizing niche differences and fitness differences that measure the range of conditions com- patible with multispecies coexistence, incorporating the effects of indirect interactions emerg- ing in diverse systems.We show how our measures can be used to quantify the extent to which the conditions for coexistence in multispecies systems differ from those that allow pairwise coexistence, and apply the method to a field system of annual plants.We conclude by present- ing new challenges and empirical opportunities emerging from our structural metrics of multi- species coexistence.

abstract = {Faster-than-expected post-glacial migration rates of trees have puzzled ecologists for a long time. In Europe, post-glacial migration is assumed to have started from the three southern European peninsulas (southern refugia), where large areas remained free of permafrost and ice at the peak of the last glaciation. However, increasing palaeobotanical evidence for the presence of isolated tree populations in more northerly microrefugia has started to change this perception. Here we use the Northern Eurasian Plant Macrofossil Database and palaeoecological literature to show that post-glacial migration rates for trees may have been substantially lower (60-260 m yr-1) than those estimated by assuming migration from southern refugia only (115-550 m yr-1), and that early-successional trees migrated faster than mid- and late-successional trees. Post-glacial migration rates are in good agreement with those recently projected for the future with a population dynamical forest succession and dispersal model, mainly for early-successional trees and under optimal conditions. Although migration estimates presented here may be conservative because of our assumption of uniform dispersal, tree migration-rates clearly need reconsideration. We suggest that small outlier populations may be a key factor in understanding past migration rates and in predicting potential future range-shifts. The importance of outlier populations in the past may have an analogy in the future, as many tree species have been planted beyond their natural ranges, with a more beneficial microclimate than their regional surroundings. Therefore, climate-change-induced range-shifts in the future might well be influenced by such microrefugia. {\textcopyright} 2013 Feurdean et al.},

abstract = {Weeds are both harmful for agricultural production and an essential component of biodiversity in agricultural landscapes. Therefore, new cropping systems aiming at both maximising weed-related biodiversity and minimising weed harmfulness are needed. New cropping systems are now increasingly designed with weed dynamics models but these usually only consider weed densities or crop yield losses. The present paper proposed a set of indicators for assessing the impact on crop production and biodiversity of weed communities simulated with a cropping system model. Five harmfulness indicators were developed to take account of the criteria most frequently listed by farmers via an internet survey: (1) crop yield loss, (2) harvest pollution by weed seeds, stems and leaves, (3) harvesting problems due to green weed biomass blocking the combine, and (4) field infestation represented by weed biomass averaged over cropping seasons. A fifth indicator was added, i.e. (5) the increase in crop disease (i.e. take-all disease of cereals) in the presence of weeds. The biodiversity indicators were chosen in collaboration with ecologists. Two indicators reflect the weed contribution to vegetal biodiversity: (1) species richness and (2) Pielou's index for species equitability. Three other indicators were developed to assess weeds as a trophic resource for other organisms in the agro-ecosystems: (3) the number of weed seeds present on soil surface in autumn and winter to feed field birds, (4) lipid-rich seeds on soil surface in summer to feed insects such as carabids, and (5) weed flowers in spring and summer to feed domestic bees. These indicators were tested in a series of contrasted cropping systems identified in farm surveys and simulated with FlorSys. Analyses of variance showed that the cropping system and the crop sequence presented the highest impact on indicator values. Weather scenario and pedoclimate had little effect. Antagonisms and synergies between weed-related harmfulness and biodiversity were identified with Spearman correlations. Harmfulness indicators were all positively correlated, except for additional disease risk which was at best poorly correlated with other indicators. Most weed-related biodiversity indicators were also positively correlated, except species richness which was negatively correlated with species equitability, bird resource and insect resource. Weed harmfulness generally increased with increasing weed-related biodiversity. These correlations were though weak, and others were negative, showing that increased biodiversity could occur with decreased harmfulness (e.g. trophic resource for insects vs. yield loss or field infestation). Consequently, there are cropping systems that reconcile agricultural production and biodiversity. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {We present a model of a source-sink competitive metacommunity, defined as a regional set of communities in which local diversity is maintained by dispersal. Although the conditions of local and regional coexistence have been well defined in such systems, no study has attempted to provide clear predictions of classical community-wide patterns. Here we provide predictions for species richness, species relative abundances, and community-level functional properties (productivity and space occupation) at the local and regional scales as functions of the proportion of dispersal between communities. Local (alpha) diversity is maximal at an intermediate level of dispersal, whereas between-community (beta) and regional (gamma) diversity decline as dispersal increases because of increased homogenization of the metacommunity. The relationships between local and regional species richness and the species rank abundance distributions are strongly affected by the level of dispersal. Local productivity and space occupation tend to decline as dispersal increases, resulting in either a hump-shaped or a positive relationship between species richness and productivity, depending on the scale considered (local or regional). These effects of dispersal are buffered by decreasing species dispersal success. Our results provide a niche-based alternative to the recent neutral-metacommunity model and have important implications for conservation biology and landscape management.},

abstract = {The position of the Arctic treeline, which is a key regulator of surface energy exchange and carbon cycling, is widely thought to be controlled by temperature. Here, we present evidence that soil nutrient availability, rather than temperature, may be the proximate control on growth of treeline trees at our study site in northwest Alaska. We examined constraints on growth and allocation of white spruce in three contrasting habitats. The habitats had similar aboveground climates, but soil temperature declined from the riverside terrace to the forest to the treeline. We identified six lines of evidence that conflict with the hypothesis of direct temperature control and/or point to the importance of soil nutrient availability. First, the magnitude of aboveground growth declined from the terrace to the forest to the treeline, along gradients of diminishing soil nitrogen (N) availability and needle N concentration. Second, peak rates of branch extension, main stem radial and fine-root growth were generally not coincident with seasonal air and soil temperature maxima. At the treeline, in particular, rates of aboveground and fine-root growth declined well before air and soil temperatures reached their seasonal peaks. Third, in contrast with the hypothesis of temperature-limited growth, growing season average net photosynthesis was positively related to the sum of normalized branch extension, main stem radial and fine-root growth across trees and sites. Fourth, needle nonstructural carbohydrate concentration was significantly higher on the terrace, where growth was greatest. Fifth, annual branch extension growth was positively related to snow depth, consistent with the hypothesis that deeper snow promotes microbial activity and greater soil nutrient availability. Finally, the tree ring record revealed a large growth increase during late 20th-century climate warming on the terrace, where soil N availability is relatively high. Meanwhile, trees in the forest and at the treeline showed progressively smaller growth increases. Our results suggest temperature effects on tree growth at our study sites may be mediated by soil nutrient availability, making responses to climate change more complex and our ability to interpret the tree ring record more challenging than previously thought.},

We propose an integrative framework linking ecological theory, empirical data and statistical models to understand the distribution of species and their abundances together with the underlying community assembly dynamics. We illustrate our approach with 21 plant species in the French Alps. We show that a spatially nested modelling framework significantly improves the model's performance and that the spatial variations of species presence-absence and abundances are predominantly explained by different factors. We also show that incorporating abiotic, dispersal and biotic factors into the same model bring new insights to our understanding of community assembly. This approach, at the crossroads between community ecology and biogeography, is a promising avenue for a better understanding of species co-existence and biodiversity distribution.},

abstract = {Microsatellite analysis was used to examine parentage and spatial distributions of 62 adult bur oaks Quercus macrocarpa, and 100 saplings in a single stand. Using genotypes scored by PCR products at four microsatellite loci, we determined that 94 saplings matched at least one parent in the stand. Saplings often occur as dense clusters of half-sibs around the presumed maternal parent, and only four adults were seed parents to a large proportion of the saplings sampled. A stump apparently was the seed parent of the largest cluster of half-sibs, which occupied a sizeable light gap opened up by the death of their maternal tree. Approximately half of the saplings appeared to have grown from seeds that had not been removed after falling from the tree, and half from seeds that were dispersed beyond the crown of their maternal parent. Long-distance seed dispersal may be more common than has been previously reported. Extremely high levels of long-distance pollination were indicated, and pollen donors within the stand were generally distributed randomly around maternal trees. More than half of the saplings had paternal parents outside of the stand. This study demonstrates the utility of microsatellite analysis for studying mating systems, seed dispersal and seedling establishment in natural plant populations.},

To investigate the effects of field landscapes and Pinus plantations on genetic diversity and the structure of Araucaria angustifolia populations, eight microsatellite loci were used to analyze 400 seeds and 87 reproductive trees, present in four forest remnants (Patches). The studied patches are inserted into different landscape matrices, two in natural field (Farm X) and two in Pinus forestation (Farm Z). The analysis showed high population genetic diversity (He, ranged from 0.16 to 0.83) with no significant difference among adults. No differences between farms were verified by co-ancestry coefficient (FFA = 0.002, P {\textgreater} 0.05). These results suggest that there was a historical connectivity between the locations. Significant fixation indices were detected in seeds from Farm Z (F = 0.076, P {\textless} 0.05) and in the total analyzed seeds (F = 0.052, P {\textless} 0.05), indicating allele fixation, possibly by crossing among relatives. The genetic divergence observed among adults and seed populations (FAS = 0,029, P {\textless} 0.05) coupled with the presence of unique alleles in all populations, suggest that not all the genetic variability of the analyzed adults is being passed on to the seeds, especially in Farm Z. On the other hand, there was an important pollen contribution from outside patches for seed formation, in both farms.},

abstract = {The paired source and sink concepts are used increasingly in ecology and Earth sciences, but they have evolved in divergent directions, hampering communication across disciplines. We propose a conceptual framework that unifies existing definitions, and review their most significant consequences for the various disciplines. A general definition of the source and sink concepts that transcends disciplines is based on net flows between the components of a system: a source is a subsystem that is a net exporter of some living or non-living entities of interest, and a sink is a net importer of these entities. Sources and sinks can further be classified as conditional and unconditional, depending on the intrinsic propensity of subsystems to either produce (source) or absorb (sink) a surplus of these entities under some (conditional) or all (unconditional) conditions. The distinction between conditional and unconditional sources and sinks, however, is strongly context dependent. Sources can turn into sinks, and vice versa, when the context is changed, when systems are subject to temporal fluctuations or evolution, or when they are considered at different spatial and temporal scales. The conservation of ecosystem services requires careful consideration of the source−sink dynamics of multiple ecosystem components. Our synthesis shows that source−sink dynamics has profound consequences for our ability to understand, predict, and manage species and ecosystems in heterogeneous landscapes.},

abstract = {1.The future of temperate forests in the face of global change and anthropogenic stressors remains uncertain. The regeneration stage, which is a critical bottleneck for many organisms, is a key indicator of forest health, future canopy composition, and forest adaptive capacity. 2.In trees, seemingly healthy forests can be at long‐term risk due to insufficient juveniles to replace them (regeneration failure), or compositional differences between juveniles and adults (regeneration mismatch). We propose ‘regeneration debt' to collectively describe regeneration failure and mismatch in analogy to extinction debt. To demonstrate this concept, we conducted a macroecological analysis of regeneration debt and anthropogenic stressors in eastern US forests. 3.Using U.S. Forest Service‐Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data, we quantified regeneration debt in 18 states from Maine to South Carolina, and evaluated the influence of site, anthropogenic stressors and climate drivers in the most affected regions. 4.We identified three distinct regions, with little debt in the north, moderate debt in the south, and severe regeneration debt in the central, mid‐Atlantic region. In this region, multiple anthropogenic stressors (invasive plants, deer overabundance, and land use) were associated with both low regeneration abundance and the prevalence of disease‐prone and/or suboptimal species. 5.Synthesis and applications. Without management intervention, the severe regeneration debt in the mid‐Atlantic region will likely lead to long‐term declines in forest cover, with cascading negative effects on forest‐dependent taxa and ecosystem services. Moreover, the location of the regeneration debt, which is at the northern edge of and involves many of the tree species that are predicted to gain suitable habitat in the Northeastern US, has consequences that extend far beyond its current geographic extent. In fact, this regeneration debt may already be functioning as a barrier to poleward tree migration. Our results demonstrate the value of regeneration debt as an indicator of ecosystem health and forest adaptive capacity.},

abstract = {Given the significance of animal dispersal to population dynamics and geographic variability, understanding how dispersal is impacted by landscape patterns has major ecological and conservation importance. Speaking to the importance of dispersal, the use of linear mixed models to compare genetic differentiation with pairwise resistance derived from landscape resistance surfaces has presented new opportunities to disentangle the menagerie of factors behind effective dispersal across a given landscape. Here, we combine these approaches with novel resistance surface parameterization to determine how the distribution of high- and low-quality seasonal habitat and individual landscape components shape patterns of gene flow for the greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) across Wyoming. We found that pairwise resistance derived from the distribution of low-quality nesting and winter, but not summer, seasonal habitat had the strongest correlation with genetic differentiation. Although the patterns were not as strong as with habitat distribution, multivariate models with sagebrush cover and landscape ruggedness or forest cover and ruggedness similarly had a much stronger fit with genetic differentiation than an undifferentiated landscape. In most cases, landscape resistance surfaces transformed with 17.33-km-diameter moving windows were preferred, suggesting small-scale differences in habitat were unimportant at this large spatial extent. Despite the emergence of these overall patterns, there were differences in the selection of top models depending on the model selection criteria, suggesting research into the most appropriate criteria for landscape genetics is required. Overall, our results highlight the importance of differences in seasonal habitat preferences to patterns of gene flow and suggest the combination of habitat suitability modeling and linear mixed models with our resistance parameterization is a powerful approach to discerning the effects of landscape on gene flow.},

abstract = {The biodiversity-ecosystem functioning (BEF) relationship is central in community ecology. Its drivers in competitive systems (sampling effect and functional complementarity) are intuitive and elegant, but we lack an integrative understanding of these drivers in complex ecosystems. Because networks encompass two key components of the BEF relationship (species richness and biomass flow), they provide a key to identify these drivers, assuming that we have a meaningful measure of functional complementarity. In a network, diversity can be defined by species richness, the number of trophic levels, but perhaps more importantly, the diversity of interactions. In this paper, we define the concept of trophic complementarity (TC), which emerges through exploitative and apparent competition processes, and study its contribution to ecosystem functioning. Using a model of trophic community dynamics, we show that TC predicts various measures of ecosystem functioning, and generate a range of testable predictions. We find that, in addition to the number of species, the structure of their interactions needs to be accounted for to predict ecosystem productivity.},

abstract = {Theoretical models imply that spatial scale derives its greatest importance through interactions between density-dependent processes and spatial variation in population densities and environmental variables. Such interactions cause population dynamics on large spatial scales to differ in important ways from predictions based on measurements of population dynamics at smaller scales, a phenomenon called the scale transition. These differences can account for large-scale population stability and species coexistence. The interactions between density dependence and spatial variation that lead to the scale transition can be understood by the process of non-linear averaging, which shows how variance originating on various spatial scales contributes to large-scale population dynamics. Variance originating below the scale of density dependence contributes less to the scale transition as the spatial scale of the variation declines, while variation originating on or above the scale of density dependence contributes independently of the spatial scale of the variation.},

abstract = {The Torreya Guardians are trying to save the Florida torreya (Torreya taxifolia Arn.) from extinction (Barlow {\&} Martin 2004). Fewer than 1000 individuals of this coniferous tree remain within its native distribution, a 35-km stretch of the Apalachicola River, and these trees are not reproducing (Schwartz et al. 2000). Even if the Florida torreya was not declining toward extinction, the species would be at risk from climate change. Warming is projected to either significantly reduce or eliminate suitable habitat for most narrowly endemic taxa (Thomas et al. 2004; Hannah et al. 2005; Peterson et al. 2006), forcing species to colonize new terrain to survive. The focus of the Torreya Guardians is an “assisted migration” program that would introduce seedlings to forests across the Southern Appalachians and Cumberland Plateau (http://www.TorreyaGuardians.org). Their intent is to avert extinction by deliberately expanding the range of this endangered plant over 500 km northward. Because planting endangered plants in new environments is relatively simple as long as seeds are legally acquired and planted with landowner permission, the Torreya Guardians believe their efforts are justified. Introducing this species to regions where it has not existed for 65 million years is “[e]asy, legal, and cheap” (Barlow {\&} Martin 2004). If circumventing climate-driven extinction is a conservation priority, then assisted migration must be considered a management option. Compelling evidence suggests that climate change will be a significant driver of extinction (McCarthy et al. 2001; McLaughlin et al. 2002; Root et al. 2003; Thomas et al. 2004). Researchers typically conclude that mitigating climate change and providing reserve networks that foster connectivity and movement should be a priority (e.g., Hannah et al. 2002). Ecologists must recognize, however, that even optimistic estimates of naturalmovement may be insufficient for species to keep pace with climate change. Assisted migration is a contentious issue that places different conservation objectives at odds with one another. This element of debate, together with the growing risk of biodiversity loss under climate change, means that nowis the time for the conservation community to consider assisted migration. Our intent here is to highlight the problem caused by a lack of a scientifically based policy on assisted migration, suggest a spectrum of policy options, and outline a framework for moving toward a consensus on this emerging conservation dilemma.},

abstract = {The demand for projections of the future distribution of biodiversity has triggered an upsurge in modelling at the crossroads between ecology and evolution. Despite the enthusiasm around these so-called biodiversity models, most approaches are still criticised for not integrating key processes known to shape species ranges and community structure. Developing an integrative modelling framework for biodiversity distribution promises to improve the reliability of predictions and to give a better understanding of the eco-evolutionary dynamics of species and communities under changing environments. In this article, we briefly review some eco-evolutionary processes and interplays among them, which are essential to provide reliable projections of species distributions and community structure. We identify gaps in theory, quantitative knowledge and data availability hampering the development of an integrated modelling framework. We argue that model development relying on a strong theoretical foundation is essential to inspire new models, manage complexity and maintain tractability. We support our argument with an example of a novel integrated model for species distribution modelling, derived from metapopulation theory, which accounts for abiotic constraints, dispersal, biotic interactions and evolution under changing environmental conditions. We hope such a perspective will motivate exciting and novel research, and challenge others to improve on our proposed approach.},

abstract = {Premise of the study: Near-future climate changes are likely to elicit major vegetation changes. Disequilibrium dynamics, which occur when vegetation comes out of equilibrium with climate, are potentially a key facet of these. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for making accurate predictions, informing conservation planning, and understanding likely changes in ecosystem function on time scales relevant to society. However, many predictive studies have instead focused on equilibrium end-points with little consideration of the transient trajectories. Methods: We review what we should expect in terms of disequilibrium vegetation dynamics over the next 50-200 yr, covering a broad range of research fields including paleoecology, macroecology, landscape ecology, vegetation science, plant ecology, invasion biology, global change biology, and ecosystem ecology. Key results: The expected climate changes are likely to induce marked vegetation disequilibrium with climate at both leading and trailing edges, with leading-edge disequilibrium dynamics due to lags in migration at continental to landscape scales, in local population build-up and succession, in local evolutionary responses, and in ecosystem development, and trailing-edge disequilibrium dynamics involving delayed local extinctions and slow losses of ecosystem structural components. Interactions with habitat loss and invasive pests and pathogens are likely to further contribute to disequilibrium dynamics. Predictive modeling and climate-change experiments are increasingly representing disequilibrium dynamics, but with scope for improvement. Conclusions: The likely pervasiveness and complexity of vegetation disequilibrium is a major challenge for forecasting ecological dynamics and, combined with the high ecological importance of vegetation, also constitutes a major challenge for future nature conservation. {\textcopyright} 2013 Botanical Society of America.},

abstract = {Management in fire-prone ecosystems relies widely upon application of prescribed fire and/or fire-surrogate (e.g., forest thinning) treatments to maintain biodiversity and ecosystem function. The literature suggests fire and mechanical treatments proved more variable in their effects on understory vegetation as compared to their effects on stand structure. The growing body of work comparing fire and thinning effects on understory vegetation offers an opportunity to increase the generality of conclusions through meta-analysis. We conducted a meta-analysis to determine if there were consistent responses of understory vegetation to these treatments in North American forests that historically experienced frequent surface fire regimes ({\textless}20 years fire return interval, FRI). Means and standard errors were extracted from 32 papers containing data on the response of four understory functional groups (herbaceous, shrub, non-native, and total) to thinning and burning treatments to calculate effect sizes. Lack of replication and inconsistent reporting of results hindered our ability to include many studies in this analysis. For each response variable (species richness and percent cover), we compared three treatment pairs: burn vs control, thin vs control and thin vs burn. We calculated standardized mean differences (Hedges' g) for each pair and tested if this differed from zero using a random effects model fit with restricted maximum likelihood to account for variation by site. The most consistent effect of the treatments was the increase in non-native species following mechanical thinning and reduction in shrub cover following a burn. These differences suggest the two treatments may not be surrogates in the short-term (less than 5 years). Increase of non-native species due to disturbance is well established but it is not clear if burning and thinning consistently have differential impacts. Response of non-native plants to disturbance is likely a complex function of a variety of site and landscape factors that cannot be evaluated by the current literature. We conclude that prescribed fire and thinning treatments can be used successfully to restore understory species richness and cover, but they can create different conditions and these potentially different outcomes need to be considered in the planning of a fuels reduction treatment. We discuss management options to reduce negative effects of the treatments and we suggest managers use current decision-making frameworks prior to designing an intervention.},

abstract = {Tropical agro-forest landscapes are global priority areas for biodiversity conservation. Little is known about the ability of these landscapes to sustain large late successional forest trees upon which much forest biodiversity depends. These landscapes are subject to fragmentation and additional habitat degradation which may limit tree recruitment and thus compromise numerous ecosystem services including carbon storage and timber production. Dysoxylum malabaricum is a large canopy tree species in the Meliaceae, a family including many important tropical timber trees. This species is found in highly fragmented forest patches within a complex agro-forest landscape of the Western Ghats biodiversity hot spot, South India. In this paper we combined a molecular assessment of inbreeding with ecological and demographic data to explore the multiple threats to recruitment of this tree species. An evaluation of inbreeding, using eleven microsatellite loci in 297 nursery-reared seedlings collected form low and high density forest patches embedded in an agro-forest matrix, shows that mating between related individuals in low density patches leads to reduced seedling performance. By quantifying habitat degradation and tree recruitment within these forest patches we show that increasing canopy openness and the increased abundance of pioneer tree species lead to a general decline in the suitability of forest patches for the recruitment of D. malabaricum. We conclude that elevated inbreeding due to reduced adult tree density coupled with increased degradation of forest patches, limit the recruitment of this rare late successional tree species. Management strategies which maintain canopy cover and enhance local densities of adult trees in agro-forest mosaics will be required to ensure D. malabaricum persists in these landscapes. Our study highlights the need for a holistic understanding of the incipient processes that threaten populations of many important and rare tropical tree species in human dominated agro-forest landscapes.},

abstract = {Models quantifying the effects of cropping systems on weed life-cycles, in interaction with environmental conditions, are invaluable tools to evaluate and design integrated cropping systems. In the past, we have developed such a model called AlomySys for a single grass weed species. The objective of the present paper was to extend the monospecific emergence model to a multi-specific weed flora, by removing a few non-generic processes (e.g. maternal effects on dormancy and germination) and by adapting the germination sub-model to a larger diversity of species. The model is based on a daily simulation of weed seedbank mortality, seasonal dormancy variations, germination and pre-emergent growth until seedling emergence, in interaction with cropping systems and environmental conditions. In order to parameterize the model for numerous and contrasting species, we developed an innovative approach consisting in estimating 25 parameters from easily accessible species traits or from empirical expert knowledge. Relationships were established between seed traits (e.g. seed coat thickness, mass or shape) and seed mortality rates, dormancy levels, speed of germination as well as pre-emergent mortality. Base temperature for germination and dates of dormancy variations were related to usual dates of the species emergence in fields, obtained from expert knowledge. The generic model structure and the trait–parameter relationships make it possible to simulate a wide diversity of weed species and to predict their response to a large range of cropping systems. Thanks to a daily time-step and the integration of the interactions with soil and climatic conditions, FlorSys permits to optimize the choice of cultural techniques for weed management, as a function of field characteristics and previous technical operations. For instance, the model was used to compare the emergence of different weed species depending on tillage, in interaction with the preceding technical operations.},

abstract = {Growth of plants results from two opposing factors: the intrinsic tendency toward unlimited increase (biotic potential) and restraints imposed by environmental resistance and aging. The expansion tendency prevails in the beginning of a tree's life, while growth decline becomes prominent toward the end. The existing growth equations can be transformed (by differentiation, decomposition into the division components, and taking logarithms) so that the components that correspond to these two factors are exposed. This transformation reveals two basic forms intrinsic in most of the analyzed equations. Their common feature is that growth expansion is proportional to current tree size. Growth decline of individual trees appears to be more variable and can be rendered with equal accuracy by a variety of expressions. This may reflect that a greater number of factors hinder growth: scarcity of resources, competition, reproduction, diseases, herbivory, disturbances, etc. Consequently, the growth path is inherently imprecise and can be viewed as a wide valley rather than a single line. This analysis laid groundwork for the classification of known equations and made possible the discovery of a promising new equation form. For. Sci. 39(3):594-616.},

@article{Chesson2003,
abstract = {Temporal fluctuations in recruitment are involved in two distinct coexistence mechanisms, the storage effect and relative nonlinearity of competition, which may act simultaneously to stabilize species coexistence. It is shown that comparisons of recruitment variation between species at high versus low densities can test whether these mechanisms are responsible for stable coexistence. Moreover, under certain circumstances, these comparisons can measure the total coexistence stabilizing effect of the mechanism. These comparisons are clearest for the situation of an invader (a species perturbed to low density) in the presence of its competitors, termed residents. Then average invader-resident differences in the variances of log recruitment, potentially weighted by adult survival rates and species' sensitivities to competition, are proportional to the overall stabilizing effect of the storage effect and relative nonlinearity of competition. Less effective comparisons are available for species naturally at high and low densities or with substantial mean differences in average fitness. These developments lead also to a technique of partitioning the long-term low-density growth rate of a species into community average measures of stabilizing mechanisms, deviations from these measures, and other factors. The community average measure is argued as most appropriate for understanding the ability of a coexistence mechanism to stabilize coexistence. Individual species' deviations from the community average indicate the ways in a which a coexistence mechanism may affect average fitness differences between species either enhancing or diminishing the ability of a given set of species to coexist, depending on other factors. This approach provides a general new tool for analyzing species coexistence. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In biome Pampa, Brazil, cattle farmers have managed the natural grasslands using practices that result in overgrazing, low productivity and low farm income. In addition, farmers in the region converted natural grasslands from beef production to more profitable activities, such as cash crops. This conversion and overgrazing have caused environmental problems in biome Pampa. Although several innovations that increase beef productivity without damaging the environment are currently available to farmers in the region, the adoption rate remains low. This study used the theory of planned behavior (TPB) to identify the beliefs that influence farmers' intention to use improved natural grassland. The TPB hypothesizes that adoption is driven by intention, which in turn is determined by three psychological constructs: attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control. These three constructs are derived from behavioral, normative and control beliefs, respectively. Results show that attitude had a strong impact on intention, followed by subjective norm and perceived behavioral control. Results also show that farmers' intention to use improved natural grassland depends on the extent to which farmers think this innovation allows for increasing the cattle density, the extent to which they think family and cattle traders support them in their decision to adopt and the extent to which farmers think they have sufficient knowledge and access to technical assistance.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT Dispersal is a key process in determining the survival of plant species following habitat fragmentation and climate change, as well as driving the introduction and spread of invasive alien species in new regions. Due to its passive nature, seed dispersal is particularly complex, and the rare long-distance events relevant for plant species' responses to environmental change are a barrier to its under- standing. Attempts to simplify the seed dispersal process often ignore dispersal by humans, despite the huge influence humans have over ecological systems throughout the world. In this Biodiversity Viewpoint, we describe how the movement patterns of humans and human-mediated dispersal vectors can be useful for understanding potential patterns of dispersal at multiple spatial scales. Humans and their associated dispersal vectors such as livestock and motor vehicles can disperse huge numbers of seeds of many plant species very long distances. Their relationships with the physical environment affect their movement, and therefore the movement of the seeds which they can potentially disperse. Therefore, we believe that a geographical approach can be useful at a time where understanding and managing pathways of dispersal are of direct relevance to the challenges faced by plant species and communities.},

@article{Loreau2013,
abstract = {The paired source and sink concepts are used increasingly in ecology and Earth sciences, but they have evolved in divergent directions, hampering communication across disciplines. We propose a conceptual framework that unifies existing definitions, and review their most significant consequences for the various disciplines. A general definition of the source and sink concepts that transcends disciplines is based on net flows between the components of a system: a source is a subsystem that is a net exporter of some living or non-living entities of interest, and a sink is a net importer of these entities. Sources and sinks can further be classified as conditional and unconditional, depending on the intrinsic propensity of subsystems to either produce (source) or absorb (sink) a surplus of these entities under some (conditional) or all (unconditional) conditions. The distinction between conditional and unconditional sources and sinks, however, is strongly context dependent. Sources can turn into sinks, and vice versa, when the context is changed, when systems are subject to temporal fluctuations or evolution, or when they are considered at different spatial and temporal scales. The conservation of ecosystem services requires careful consideration of the source−sink dynamics of multiple ecosystem components. Our synthesis shows that source−sink dynamics has profound consequences for our ability to understand, predict, and manage species and ecosystems in heterogeneous landscapes.},

abstract = {Aim Four long-distance dispersal (LDD) modes have generally been considered to play central roles in the colonization of islands by plants: anemochory (dispersal by wind), thalassochory (dispersal by oceanic currents), endozoochory (internal dis-persal by animals) and epizoochory (external dispersal by animals). However, seeds can also be transported by vectors different from those to which they are best suited (non-standard dispersal), meaning that the actual vector of colonization cannot be inferred based on diaspore traits alone. We propose an alternative approach to explore the relative contribution of LDD syndromes to island colonization. Location Europe and the Azores. Methods We scored the presence of syndromes relevant for LDD in the native flora of Europe (c . 10,000 species) and the Azores (148 species). We then contrasted the importance of each syndrome in the recipient flora (Azores) and the source floras (Europe and mainland Portugal) to estimate which, if any, syndrome was particularly successful for overseas colonizatio n. We further investigated whether particular LDD syndromes increased plant distribution within the Azores archipelago. Results Most native species in Europe (63{\%}), mainland Portugal (67{\%}) and the Azores (63{\%}) produce unspecialized diaspores. Only species adapted to sea disper-sal were overrepresented in the Azores, while those adapted to wind dispersal were underrepresented. The presence of LDD syndromes did not significantly improve the distribution of plant species across the archipelago, except for the moderate advantage of endozoochorous diaspores. Differences in the importance of LDD syndromes across plant families at least partially explain the floristic disharmony of the Azorean flora. Main conclusions Only thalassochory appeared to have significantly favoured the colonization of the Azores. The high proportion of unspecialized diaspores, the unexceptional representation of most specialized LDD syndromes and the disso-ciation between syndromes and inter-island plant distribution in the Azores suggest that non-standard events are more common than previously believed in the colo-nization of islands by plants.},

abstract = {Increasing concern about loss of biodiversity and its effects on ecosystem functioning has triggered a series of manipulative experiments worldwide, which have demonstrated a general trend for ecosystem functioning to increase with diversity. General mechanisms proposed to explain diversity effects include complementary resource use and invoke a key role for species' functional traits. The actual mechanisms by which complementary resource use occurs remain, however, poorly understood, as well as whether they apply to tree-dominated ecosystems. Here we present an experimental approach offering multiple innovative aspects to the field of biodiversity-ecosystem functioning (BEF) research. The International Diversity Experiment Network with Trees (IDENT) allows research to be conducted at several hierarchical levels within individuals, neighborhoods, and communities. The network investigates questions related to intraspecific trait variation, complementarity, and environmental stress. The goal of IDENT is to identify some of the mechanisms through which individuals and species interact to promote coexistence and the complementary use of resources. IDENT includes several implemented and planned sites in North America and Europe, and uses a replicated design of high-density tree plots of fixed species-richness levels varying in functional diversity (FD). The design reduces the space and time needed for trees to interact allowing a thorough set of mixtures varying over different diversity gradients (specific, functional, phylogenetic) and environmental conditions (e.g., water stress) to be tested in the field. The intention of this paper is to share the experience in designing FD-focused BEF experiments with trees, to favor collaborations and expand the network to different conditions.},

We investigated 13 covariates in four categories: climate, air pollutants, topography, and stand characteristics. Overall, we found that tree mortality was most sensitive to stand characteristics and air pollutants.

abstract = {According to theory, edge populations may be the best suited to initiate range expansions and climate-driven range shifts if they are locally adapted to extreme edge conditions, or the worst suited to colonize beyond-range habitat if their offspring are genetically and competitively inferior. We tested these contrasting predictions by comparing fitness of low, mid, and high-elevation (edge) populations of the annual Rhinanthus minor, transplanted throughout and above its elevational distribution under natural and experimentally-warmed conditions. Seed from low-quality edge habitat had inferior emergence across sites, but high-elevation seeds were also locally adapted. High-elevation plants initiated flowering earlier than plants from lower populations, required less heat accumulation to mature seed, and so achieved higher lifetime fitness at high elevations. Fitness was strongly reduced above the range, but adaptive phenology enhanced the relative fitness of high-elevation seeds. Experimental warming improved fitness above the range, confirming climate's importance in limiting R. minor's distribution, but eliminated the advantage of local cold-edge populations. These results provide experimental support for recent models in which cold-adapted edge populations do not always facilitate warming-induced range shifts. The highest fitness above the range was achieved by a 'super edge phenotype' from a neighboring mountain, suggesting key adaptations exist at the regional scale even if absent from local edge populations. Our results demonstrate that assessing the value of edge populations will not be straightforward, but suggest that a regional approach to their conservation, potentially enhancing gene flow among them, might maximize species' ability to respond to global change.},

Twelve populations were collected across an altitudinal gradient (1650-2520 m above sea level [asl]) in a mountainous zone in the central-west region of the Mexican Trans-Volcanic Belt, and were planted in common garden tests at three forest sites of different altitudes (low: 2110, medium: 2422 and upper: 2746 m asl). Climate was estimated using a spline climatic model at the seed source and test sites and also measured using in situ data loggers. Survivorship and seedling height were evaluated in the field during the second and third growing seasons. Results were analyzed using mixed models to include the effect of climatic transfer distances (difference in climate between seed source and test site). Significant differences were found in seedling growth among Pinus devoniana, P. pseudostrobus and P. leiophylla, and among populations within the former two species. These were associated primarily with climatic transfer distances of extreme temperatures (minimum temperature in the coldest month and mean temperature in the warmest month). There was a significant decrease in growth in P. devoniana when the transfer exceeded 650 m of upward altitudinal shift or a reduction of 1.58C with transfer to colder sites. There was also a decrease of growth in P. pseudostrobus when transfer exceeded 400 m of upward altitudinal shift or 1.58C, with a significant decrease in survivorship. Pinus leiophylla, however, exhibited similar growth at all altitudes tested, probably due to phenotypic plasticity. Although further research is required with field tests using commercial spacing and trees of older ages, the results suggest that an assisted upwards migration of 300 m in altitude, in order to approach a realignment of the populations to the climate projected for the decade centered around the year 2030, appears to be a viable strategy with which to accommodate the effects of climate change.},

abstract = {Objective: To review the recent research into human-mediated dispersal (HMD) in the European rural landscape, and explore the potential positive aspect of HMD for grassland conservation, in contrast to it's common association with the spread of invasive species. Methods: A literature search was undertaken to identify HMD vectors in the rural landscape for discussion regarding dispersal potential past and present, implications for management, and the identification of future research needs. Results: Grazing animals are important propagule dispersers, but the reduced movement of livestock through the landscape has also meant a reduction in seeds dispersed in this way. Other, non-standard human-mediated dispersal vectors such as clothing and motor vehicles can also transport seeds of many species, and HMD vectors often transport seeds with a variety of dispersal specialisations. Recommendations: There should be a greater movement of grazing animals throughout the landscape, either within larger grazing areas or between existing grasslands. Where this is not possible, other, more directed dispersal of propagules from species-rich communities to target sites should be considered. The potential of non-standard HMD vectors to make a positive contribution to biodiversity should be considered, but more research into all types of HMD vectors is important if we are to fully understand their role in the dispersal of plant species in fragmented landscapes.},

Our goal is for both theoretical and empirical ecologists to be able to use the theory to interpret their findings, and to get a precise sense of the limits of its applicability. To this end, we introduce an explicit handling of limiting factors, and a new way of defining the scaling factors that partition invasion growth rates into the different mechanisms contributing to coexistence. We explain terminology such as relative nonlinearity, storage effect, and growth-density covariance, both in a formal setting and through their biological interpretation. We review the theory's applications and contributions to our current understanding of species coexistence. While the theory is very general, it is not well suited to all problems, so we carefully point out its limitations. Finally, we critique the paradigm of decomposing invasion growth rates into stabilizing and equalizing components: we argue that these concepts are useful when used judiciously, but have often been employed in an overly simplified way to justify false claims.},

To anticipate these shifts, we need to understand the forces that determine where species currently occur. We tested whether a long-hypothesised trade-off between climate and competitive constraints explains where tree species grow on mountain slopes. Using tree rings, we reconstructed growth sensitivity to climate and competition in range centre and range margin tree populations in three climatically distinct regions. We found that climate often constrains growth at environmentally harsh elevational range boundaries, and that climatic and competitive constraints trade-off at large spatial scales. However, there was less evidence that competition consistently constrained growth at benign elevational range boundaries; thus, local-scale climate-competition trade-offs were infrequent. Our work underscores the difficulty of predicting local-scale range dynamics, but suggests that the constraints on tree performance at a large-scale (e.g. latitudinal) may be predicted from ecological theory.},

This study aims to better understand this sudden shift in recruitment dynamics. We performed an extensive analysis of the age structure, radial growth pattern, and release history on {\textgreater}700 saplings from 34 mature maple-beech stands of southern Quebec. We found (i) that the sapling age structures showed a progressive decrease in the establishment of maple relative to beech starting about 40 years ago, (ii) a change in the species growth hierarchy that started in the 1980s due to increasing radial growth of beech, (iii) that this growth trend is negligible for both maple and beech when we account for size and suppression status, and finally (iv) that the growth trend appears to be independent of present soil conditions. These results contrast with previous studies conducted at the adult stage that reported a growth decline for maple. We conclude that this change in recruitment dynamics is not related to growth, and consequently, further studies investigating this phenomenon should concentrate on establishment and survival.},

abstract = {Macroecology and biogeography are concerned with understanding biodiversity patterns across space and time. In the past, the two disciplines have addressed this question mainly with correlative approaches, despite frequent calls for more mechanistic explanations. Recent advances in computational power, theoretical understanding, and statistical tools are, however, currently facilitating the development of more system-oriented, mechanistic models. We review these models, identify different model types and theoretical frameworks, compare their processes and properties, and summarize emergent findings. We show that ecological (physiology, demographics, dispersal, biotic interactions) and evolutionary processes, as well as environmental and human-induced drivers, are increasingly modelled mechanistically; and that new insights into biodiversity dynamics emerge from these models. Yet, substantial challenges still lie ahead for this young research field. Among these, we identify scaling, calibration, validation, and balancing complexity as pressing issues. Moreover, particular process combinations are still understudied, and so far models tend to be developed for specific applications. Future work should aim at developing more flexible and modular models that not only allow different ecological theories to be expressed and contrasted, but which are also built for tight integration with all macroecological data sources. Moving the field towards such a ‘systems macroecology' will test and improve our understanding of the causal pathways through which eco-evolutionary processes create diversity patterns across spatial and temporal scales.},

@article{Bugmann2001,
abstract = {Forest gap models, initially conceived in 1969 as a special case of individual-tree based models, have become widely popular among forest ecologists for addressing a large number of applied research questions, including the impacts of global change on long-term dynamics of forest structure, biomass, and composition. However, they have been strongly criticized for a number of weaknesses inherent in the original model structure. In this paper, I review the fundamental assumptions underlying forest gap models, the structure of the parent model JABOWA, and examine these criticisms in the context of the many alternative formulations that have been developed over the past 30 years. Four assumptions originally underlie gap models: (1) The forest is abstracted as a composite of many small patches of land, where each can have a different age and successional stage; (2) patches are horizontally homogeneous, i.e., tree position within a patch is not considered; (3) the leaves of each tree are located in an indefinitely thin layer (disk) at the top of the stem; and (4) successional processes are described on each patch separately, i.e., there are no interactions between patches. These simplifications made it possible to consider mixed-species, mixed-age forests, which had been difficult previously mainly because of computing limitations. The structure of JABOWA is analysed in terms of the functional relationships used for formulating the processes of tree establishment, growth, and mortality. It is concluded that JABOWA contains a number of unrealistic assumptions that have not been questioned strongly to date. At the same time, some aspects of JABOWA that were criticized strongly in the past years are internally consistent given the objectives of this specific model. A wide variety of formulations for growth processes, establishment, and mortality factors have been developed in gap models over the past 30 years, and modern gap models include more robust parameterizations of environmental influences on tree growth and population dynamics as compared to JABOWA. Approaches taken in more recent models that led to the relaxation of one or several of the four basic assumptions are discussed. It is found that the original assumptions often have been replaced by alternatives; however, no systematic analysis of the behavioral effects of these conceptual changes has been attempted to date. The feasibility of including more physiological detail (instead of using relatively simple parameterizations) in forest gap models is discussed, and it is concluded that we often lack the data base to implement such approaches for more than a few commercially important tree species. Hence, it is important to find a compromise between using simplistic parameterizations and expanding gap models with physiology-based functions and parameters that are difficult to estimate. While the modeling of tree growth has received a lot of attention over the past years, much less effort has been spent on improving the formulations of tree establishment and mortality, although these processes are likely to be just as sensitive to global change as tree growth itself. Finally, model validation issues are discussed, and it is found that there is no single data source that can reliably be used for evaluating the behavior of forest gap models; instead, I propose a combination of sensitivity analyses, qualitative examinations of process formulations, and quantitative tests of gap models or selected submodels against various kinds of empirical data to evaluate the usefulness of these models for assessing their utility for predicting the impacts of global change on long-term forest dynamics.},

abstract = {* There is a growing realization among community ecologists that interactions between species vary across space and time and that this variation needs to be quantified. Our current numerical framework to analyse the structure of species interactions, based on graph-theoretical approaches, usually do not consider the variability of interactions. As this variability has been show to hold valuable ecological information, there is a need to adapt the current measures of network structure so that they can exploit it. * We present analytical expressions of key measures of network structured, adapted so that they account for the variability of ecological interactions. We do so by modelling each interaction as a Bernoulli event; using basic calculus allows expressing the expected value, and when mathematically tractable, its variance. When applied to non-probabilistic data, the measures we present give the same results as their non-probabilistic formulations, meaning that they can be generally applied. * We present three case studies that highlight how these measures can be used, in re-analysing data that experimentally measured the variability of interactions, to alleviate the computational demands of permutation-based approaches, and to use the frequency at which interactions are observed over several locations to infer the structure of local networks. We provide a free and open-source implementation of these measures. * We discuss how both sampling and data representation of ecological networks can be adapted to allow the application of a fully probabilistic numerical network approach.},

abstract = {Considerable evidence exists that current global temperatures are higher than at any time during the past millennium. However, the long-term impacts of rising temperatures and associated shifts in the hydrological cycle on the productivity of ecosystems remain poorly understood for mid to high northern latitudes. Here, we quantify species-specific spatiotemporal variability in terrestrial aboveground biomass stem growth across Canada's boreal forests from 1950 to the present. We use 873 newly developed tree-ring chronologies from Canada's National Forest Inventory, representing an unprecedented degree of sampling standardization for a largescale dendrochronological study. We find significant regional- and species-related trends in growth, but the positive and negative trends compensate each other to yield no strong overall trend in forest growth when averaged across the Canadian boreal forest. The spatial patterns of growth trends identified in our analysis were to some extent coherent with trends estimated by remote sensing, but there are wide areas where remote-sensing information did not match the forest growth trends. Quantifications of tree growth variability as a function of climate factors and atmospheric CO2 concentration reveal strong negative temperature and positive moisture controls on spatial patterns of tree growth rates, emphasizing the ecological sensitivity to regime shifts in the hydrological cycle. An enhanced dependence of forest growth on soil moisture during the late-20th century coincides with a rapid rise in summer temperatures and occurs despite potential compensating effects from increased atmospheric CO2 concentration.},

abstract = {All ecologists are familiar with uncertainty, at least at the level of whether they should reject a null hypothesis. Uncertainty is, however, pervasive and its characterization is essential if we are to understand our effects on ecosystems. Traditional fisheries management has a poor track record for confronting uncertainty, but most management authorities are now committed to a precautionary approach. As a result, some of the most interesting methods for taking account of uncertainty in ecological systems have been developed by fisheries scientists. These methods evaluate the relative performance of different management procedures with the use of mathematical and statistical models that synthesize knowledge and speculation about the system of interest. Recent advances in computer-intensive statistics have made it possible to combine this approach with model fitting, so that the uncertainties and risks associated with different outcomes of management can be quantified. We show how this methodology can be applied to a range of ecological problems where the advice that scientists provide to decision makers is likely to be clouded by uncertainty.},

abstract = {Increasing biodiversity loss due to climate change is one of the most vital challenges of the 21st century. To anticipate and mitigate biodiversity loss, models are needed that reliably project species' range dynamics and extinction risks. Recently, several new approaches to model range dynamics have been developed to supplement correlative species distribution models (SDMs), but applications clearly lag behind model development. Indeed, no comparative analysis has been performed to evaluate their performance. Here, we build on process-based, simulated data for benchmarking five range (dynamic) models of varying complexity including classical SDMs, SDMs coupled with simple dispersal or more complex population dynamic models (SDM hybrids), and a hierarchical Bayesian process-based dynamic range model (DRM). We specifically test the effects of demographic and community processes on model predictive performance. Under current climate, DRMs performed best, although only marginally. Under climate change, predictive performance varied considerably, with no clear winners. Yet, all range dynamic models improved predictions under climate change substantially compared to purely correlative SDMs, and the population dynamic models also predicted reasonable extinction risks for most scenarios. When benchmarking data were simulated with more complex demographic and community processes, simple SDM hybrids including only dispersal often proved most reliable. Finally, we found that structural decisions during model building can have great impact on model accuracy, but prior system knowledge on important processes can reduce these uncertainties considerably. Our results reassure the clear merit in using dynamic approaches for modelling species' response to climate change but also emphasise several needs for further model and data improvement. We propose and discuss perspectives for improving range projections through combination of multiple models and for making these approaches operational for large numbers of species.},

abstract = {The relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (BEF) has become a cornerstone of community and ecosystem ecology and an essential criterion for making decisions in conservation biology and policy planning. It has recently been proposed that evolutionary history should influence the BEF relationship because it determines species traits and, thus, species' ability to exploit resources. Here we test this hypothesis by combining experimental evolution with a BEF experiment. We isolated 20 bacterial strains from a marine environment and evolved each to be generalists or specialists. We then tested the effect of evolutionary history on the strength of the BEF relationship with assemblages of 1 to 20 species constructed from the specialists, generalists and ancestors. Assemblages of generalists were more productive on average because of their superior ability to exploit the environmental heterogeneity. The slope of the BEF relationship was, however, stronger for the specialist assemblages because of enhanced niche complementarity. These results show how the BEF relationship depends critically on the legacy of past evolutionary events.},

Our current numerical framework to analyse the structure of species interactions, based on graph-theoretical approaches, usually do not consider the variability of interactions. As this variability has been show to hold valuable ecological information, there is a need to adapt the current measures of network structure so that they can exploit it. * We present analytical expressions of key measures of network structured, adapted so that they account for the variability of ecological interactions. We do so by modelling each interaction as a Bernoulli event; using basic calculus allows expressing the expected value, and when mathematically tractable, its variance. When applied to non-probabilistic data, the measures we present give the same results as their non-probabilistic formulations, meaning that they can be generally applied. * We present three case studies that highlight how these measures can be used, in re-analysing data that experimentally measured the variability of interactions, to alleviate the computational demands of permutation-based approaches, and to use the frequency at which interactions are observed over several locations to infer the structure of local networks. We provide a free and open-source implementation of these measures. * We discuss how both sampling and data representation of ecological networks can be adapted to allow the application of a fully probabilistic numerical network approach.},

abstract = {New Caledonia is a global biodiversity hotspot. Hypotheses for its biotic richness suggest either that the island is a 'museum' for an old Gondwana biota or alternatively it has developed following relatively recent long distance dispersal and in situ radiation. The conifer genus Araucaria (Araucariaceae) comprises 19 species globally with 13 endemic to this island. With a typically Gondwanan distribution, Araucaria is particularly well suited to testing alternative biogeographic hypotheses concerning the origins of New Caledonian biota. We derived phylogenetic estimates using 11 plastid and rDNA ITS2 sequence data for a complete sampling of Araucaria (including multiple accessions of each of the 13 New Caledonian Araucaria species). In addition, we developed a dataset comprising 4 plastid regions for a wider taxon sample to facilitate fossil based molecular dating. Following statistical analyses to identify a credible and internally consistent set of fossil constraints, divergence times estimated using a Bayesian relaxed clock approach were contrasted with geological scenarios to explore the biogeographic history of Araucaria. The phylogenetic data resolve relationships within Araucariaceae and among the main lineages in Araucaria, but provide limited resolution within the monophyletic New Caledonian species group. Divergence time estimates suggest a Late Cretaceous-Cenozoic radiation of extant Araucaria and a Neogene radiation of the New Caledonian lineage. A molecular timescale for the evolution of Araucariaceae supports a relatively recent radiation, and suggests that earlier (pre-Cenozoic) fossil types assigned to Araucaria may have affinities elsewhere in Araucariaceae. While additional data will be required to adequately resolve relationships among the New Caledonian species, their recent origin is consistent with overwater dispersal following Eocene emersion of New Caledonia but is too old to support a single dispersal from Australia to Norfolk Island for the radiation of the Pacific Araucaria sect.

We related these growth characteristics to multiple functional traits (wood density, adult stature, seed mass, leaf traits) in a hierarchical Bayesian model that accounted for measurement error and intraspecific variability of functional traits. Wood density was the most important trait determining all three growth characteristics. Intrinsic growth rates were additionally strongly related to adult stature, while all traits contributed to light response. Our analysis yielded a predictive model which allows estimation of growth characteristics for rare species on the basis of a few easily measurable morphological traits.},

abstract = {Aim To determine seed retention rates on vehicles as a function of distance driven, road surface, weather condition and seed location on the vehicle undercarriage. Location Montana, United States. Methods Metal plates were covered with a seed-soil slurry, dried and attached to different locations underneath a vehicle. The vehicle was then driven on paved and unpaved roads under both wet and dry conditions. Plates were removed from the vehicle at seven distances between 4 and 256 similar to km. The number of seeds remaining was determined. Four general models were assessed to explain observed seed retention. Results Under dry conditions, seed retention rates were high on both unpaved and paved roads, with 8699{\%} of the seeds remaining at 256 similar to km. Under wet conditions, lower rates of seed retention were observed for both road surfaces: 0.380{\%} of seeds were retained at 256 similar to km on paved wet roads and 5096{\%} of seeds were retained at 256 similar to km on unpaved wet roads. Plate location had a significant effect on seed retention under certain road surfaces and conditions, with loss generally being highest from the wheel wells. Of the statistical models compared, a double exponential model explained the most variation in seed retention. Main conclusions Vehicles act as vectors of long-distance dispersal. Seed adhered to vehicles can be retained for hundreds of kilometres under dry conditions. When wet conditions occur, a greater proportion of seeds will be dispersed shorter distances. Consequently, vehicle seed dispersal has implications for plant invasions and species migration rates, and those concerned with prevention and control of non-native plant invasions should consider vehicle seed transport when developing management strategies and plans.},

Gene flow from the outside plays a pivotal role in the fate of these marginal populations. It has been proposed that spatial fragmentation and perceived geographic isolation do not necessarily reflect a loss of genetic connectivity in tree species. However, the spatial limits of long-distance gene flow, as well as its magnitude and impact, are still generally unknown. In the present study, we analyzed long-distance pollen-mediated gene flow into an isolated relict stand consisting of 7 individuals of Quercus robur L. based on a total sample of 177 trees and 9 microsatellite loci. We show that pollen-mediated gene flow across more than 80 km in this wind-pollinated tree species contributed at least 35{\%} of all successful pollinations in the investigated isolated and small oak stand at the eastern limit of the species' distribution. The observed pollen immigration shaped the genetic diversity of acorn progenies in the stand and might explain the comparably high genetic diversity in the persisting adult population. {\textcopyright} 2011 The American Genetic Association.

abstract = {Traits affecting survival from seedling through adult stages are key elements of tree life histories, and it is widely assumed that variation in survival of adult trees plays an important role in the distribution of species along climate gradients. We use data from plots censused by the U.S. Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis program during the years 2000-2011 to quantify relationships between two key aspects of climate-mean annual temperature and growing season water deficit-and rates of sapling and canopy tree survival for the 50 most common tree species in the eastern United States. Our analyses include consideration of the effects of tree size, competition, and nitrogen deposition to avoid confounding effects and to provide context for the importance of variation in climate relative to other factors. Tree size and competitive effects, including the effect of tree size on sensitivity to competition, had the greatest impact on observed variation in survival for all of the species. Survival varied as a function of nitrogen deposition in 20 of the 50 species, and responses were stronger in saplings than in canopy trees. Despite clear sorting of the presence of the tree species along regional gradients of temperature and water deficit, there was only modest evidence that either sapling or canopy tree mortality varied systematically along those gradients. For 24 of the 50 species, the most parsimonious models did not include either temperature or water deficit variables. The exceptions to this were for several species of colder climates in which survival declined significantly in warmer climates. In 40 of the 50 species, there was no significant variation in survival as a function of either average growing season water deficit or the most extreme individual growing season water deficit during the 20 yr preceding the end of the census interval. The frequency of all but the most xeric of our study species declines at some point along a water deficit gradient. But it is seedling survival (reported in earlier work), rather than survival of saplings and canopy trees, that varies systematically along water deficit gradients.},

abstract = {Ecological theory suggests that spatial distribution of biodiversity is strongly driven by community assembly processes. Thus the study of diversity patterns combined with null model testing has become increasingly common to infer assembly processes from observed distributions of diversity indices. However, results in both empirical and simulation studies are inconsistent. The aim of our study is to determine with simulated data which facets of biodiversity, if any, may unravel the processes driving its spatial patterns, and to provide practical considerations about the combination of diversity indices that would produce significant and congruent signals when using null models. The study is based on simulated species' assemblages that emerge under various landscape structures in a spatially explicit individual-based model with contrasting, predefined assembly processes. We focus on four assembly processes (species-sorting, mass effect, neutral dynamics and competition colonization trade-off) and investigate the emerging species' distributions with varied diversity indices (alpha, beta and gamma) measured at different spatial scales and for different diversity facets (taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic). We find that 1) the four assembly processes result in distinct spatial distributions of species under any landscape structure, 2) a broad range of diversity indices allows distinguishing between communities driven by different assembly processes, 3) null models provide congruent results only for a small fraction of diversity indices and 4) only a combination of these diversity indices allows identifying the correct assembly processes. Our study supports the inference of assembly processes from patterns of diversity only when different types of indices are combined. It highlights the need to combine phylogenetic, functional and taxonomic diversity indices at multiple spatial scales to effectively infer underlying assembly processes from diversity patterns by illustrating how combination of different indices might help disentangling the complex question of coexistence.},

abstract = {The study of islands as model systems has played an important role in the development of evolutionary and ecological theory. The 50th anniversary of MacArthur and Wilson's (December 1963) article, 'An equilibrium theory of insular zoogeography', was a recent milestone for this theme. Since 1963, island systems have provided new insights into the formation of ecological communities. Here, building on such developments, we highlight prospects for research on islands to improve our understanding of the ecology and evolution of communities in general. Throughout, we emphasise how attributes of islands combine to provide unusual research opportunities, the implications of which stretch far beyond islands. Molecular tools and increasing data acquisition now permit re-assessment of some fundamental issues that interested MacArthur and Wilson. These include the formation of ecological networks, species abundance distributions, and the contribution of evolution to community assembly. We also extend our prospects to other fields of ecology and evolution - understanding ecosystem functioning, speciation and diversification - frequently employing assets of oceanic islands in inferring the geographic area within which evolution has occurred, and potential barriers to gene flow. Although island-based theory is continually being enriched, incorporating non-equilibrium dynamics is identified as a major challenge for the future.},

abstract = {Introduction: D-dimer assay, generally evaluated according to cutoff points calibrated for VTE exclusion, is used to estimate the individual risk of recurrence after a first idiopathic event of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Methods: Commercial D-dimer assays, evaluated according to predetermined cutoff levels for each assay, specific for age (lower in subjects {\textless}70 years) and gender (lower in males), were used in the recent DULCIS study. The present analysis compared the results obtained in the DULCIS with those that might have been had using the following different cutoff criteria: traditional cutoff for VTE exclusion, higher levels in subjects aged ≥60 years, or age multiplied by 10. Results: In young subjects, the DULCIS low cutoff levels resulted in half the recurrent events that would have occurred using the other criteria. In elderly patients, the DULCIS results were similar to those calculated for the two age-adjusted criteria. The adoption of traditional VTE exclusion criteria would have led to positive results in the large majority of elderly subjects, without a significant reduction in the rate of recurrent event. Conclusion: The results confirm the usefulness of the cutoff levels used in DULCIS.},

abstract = {The competitive exclusion principle is fundamental to understanding coexistence. Well-established theories predict the conditions for coexistence in consumer–resource interactions. Given that species often compete for commodities offered by mutualists, competitive exclusion theory should also be critical to understanding how mutualisms function. We explicitly apply the competitive exclusion principle to mutualism and derive a rule analogous to Tilman's R* rule for exploitative competition. Coexistence is impossible when competitors compete solely for a shared partner-provided commodity because superior competitors deplete that commodity sufficiently to exclude inferior competitors. We then investigate how competition between two guild members for a partner-provided commodity and a resource external to the mutualism affects competitor coexistence. There are three key results. First, coexistence is possible via partitioning of a partner-provided commodity and another resource. Second, unlike in classic R* Theory, competitive outcomes are influenced both by species' abilities to obtain commodities and their mutualisms with the shared commodity-providing partner, which can indirectly alleviate competitors' commodity limitation. Third, the outcome of competition has important consequences for the commodity-providing partner, which depend on the type of mutualism and the competitive abilities of competing mutualists. This theory provides a novel framework for investigating how competitors for mutualistic commodities coexist in nature.},

abstract = {* Woodfuel extraction from established woods and forests is promoted in Western Europe as a renewable energy source. Woodfuel management is mainly carried out by silvicultural thinning or short-rotation harvesting, including coppicing. Potential negative effects include reduction in habitat quality for saproxylic species. However, in some regions, habitats may be improved for species that have declined as a result of increased shading. Resources required by most of these species are more likely to be delivered by short-rotation management than thinning. * Relatively little is documented on the effects of thinning intensity on ecological resources and biodiversity within European forests. Trade-offs between canopy cover, deer browsing pressure and understorey complexity are likely to occur. Therefore, interactions between thinning treatments and deer browsing potentially affect biodiversity, in the context of both woodfuel and timber production. * Synthesis and applications. Woodfuel management is unlikely to deliver benefits for most shade-intolerant species unless it creates substantial areas of young-growth with low deer impacts. However, more research is needed on thinning as a potential conservation tool. Changing climate and tree diseases are creating an uncertain future for forest management. It is timely for ecologists to work with forest managers to identify how integrated forestry and deer management can deliver positive and balanced biodiversity outcomes.},

Although ecologists and evolutionary biologists widely recognize the potential impacts of changes in average climatic conditions, relatively little attention has been paid to the potential impacts of changes in climatic variability and extremes. We review the evidence on the impacts of increased climatic variability and extremes on physiological, ecological and evolutionary processes at multiple levels of biological organization, from individuals to populations and communities. Our review indicates that climatic variability can have profound influences on biological processes at multiple scales of organization. Responses to increased climatic variability and extremes are likely to be complex and cannot always be generalized, although our conceptual and methodological toolboxes allow us to make informed predictions about the likely consequences of such climatic changes. We conclude that climatic variability represents an important component of climate that deserves further attention. Key},

We studied these effects by simulating primary species loss in 16 food webs from terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and measuring robustness in terms of the secondary extinctions that followed. As observed in other networks, food webs are more robust to random removal of species than to selective removal of species with the most trophic links to other species. More surprisingly, robustness increases with food-web connectance but appears independent of species richness and omnivory. In particular, food webs experience `rivet-like' thresholds past which they display extreme sensitivity to removal of highly connected species. Higher connectance delays the onset of this threshold. Removing species with few trophic connections generally has little effect though there are several striking exceptions. These findings emphasize how the number of species removed affects ecosystems differently depending on the trophic functions of species removed.},

abstract = {Assisted migration of warm-adapted genotypes to currently cooler climates may reduce maladaptation from future climate change. Few assisted migration trials have considered limitations of the cooler climates and pathogens currently present at transplant sites. This is especially important to consider in riparian ecosystems that are priority targets for restoration in the western United States as they harbor diverse communities. In an effort to validate assisted migration as an effective strategy for mediating the negative impacts of climate change, we used a provenance trial with replicated genotypes from 19 populations of the foundation riparian tree species, Fremont cottonwood (Populus fremontii), transplanted to a cold site to test for genetic variation in growth, mortality, and resistance to shoot blight fungi (Venturia sp.). Populations from cool sites had up to 4 times faster growth, 3 times higher survival, and 8 times higher resistance to Venturia than populations from warm sites, providing evidence of local adaptation to both climate and pathogenic fungi. Budburst phenology and shoot blight were correlated with frost damage, subsequent shrub-form architecture, and mortality. While climate change models predict 6°C increases, plants transferred distances of 6°C at this time would not perform well; an intermediate transfer distance of less than 3°C would avoid maladaptation to the current environment during assisted migration. Thus, multiple and intermediate transfer phases to supplement local genetic variation will likely be necessary for effective assisted migration to accommodate current environments and large changes in climate.},

abstract = {1. Coexistence between plant species is well known to depend on the outcomes of species interactions within an environmental context. The incorporation of environmental variation into empirical studies of coexistence are rare, however, due to the complex experiments needed to do so and the lack of feasible modelling approaches for determining how environmental factors alter specific coexistence mechanisms. 2. In this article, we present a simple modelling framework for assessing how variation in species interactions across environmental gradients impact on niche overlap and fitness differences, two core determinants of coexistence. We use a novel formulation of an annual plant population dynamics model that allows for competitive and facilitative species interactions and for variation in the strength and direction of these interactions across environmental gradients. Using this framework , we examine outcomes of plant-plant interactions between four commonly co-occurring annual plant species from Western Australian woodlands. We then determine how niche overlap and fitness differences between these species vary across three environmental gradients previously identified as important for struc-turing diversity patterns in this system: soil phosphorus, shade and water. 3. We found facilitation to be a widespread phenomenon and that interactions between most species pairs shift between competitive and facilitative across multiple environmental gradients. Environmental conditions also altered the strength, direction and relative variation of both niche overlap and fitness differences in nonlinear and unpredictable ways. 4. Synthesis. We provide a simple framework for incorporating environmental het-erogeneity into explorations of coexistence mechanisms. Our findings highlight the importance of the environment in determining the outcome of species interactions and the potential for pairwise coexistence between species. The prevalence of facilitation in our system indicates a need to improve current theoretical frameworks of coexistence to include noncompetitive interactions and ways of translating these effects into explicit predictions of coexistence. Our study also suggests a need for further research into determining which factors result in},

Two contrasting approaches are possible. Mechanistic mod- els describe variability with process-based, usually deterministic sub-models quantifying interactions between cropping system components and environmental conditions. Empirical models directly relate observations to input variables, using few parameters, and usually quantify variability with probabilis- tic (stochastic) functions.

abstract = {The early genetic effects of habitat degradation were investigated in the critically endangered conifer Araucaria nemorosa. This species occurs in New Caledonia, a global biodiversity hotspot where the world's greatest concentration of endemic conifer species coincides with an extremely high level of habitat destruction due to fire and mining. Using seven microsatellite loci, estimates were made of genetic marker variation, inbreeding coefficients and population differentiation of adult and seedling cohorts of A. nemorosa. These were contrasted with equivalent estimates, made over similar spatial scales and with the same marker loci, in the locally common and more widespread sister species Araucaria columnaris. There were no significant differences in population genetic parameters between adult populations of the two species, despite their different abundances. However, in A. nemorosa, the juvenile cohort showed a loss of rare alleles and elevated levels of inbreeding when compared to the adult cohort. These genetic differences between the cohorts were not observed in the locally common A. columnaris. This suggests that recent environmental degradation is influencing the genetic structure of A. nemorosa populations. Although this is not detectable among predisturbance adult populations, an early warning of these impacts is evident in more recently established seedling cohorts. The conservation implications of these results are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2007 The Authors.},

abstract = {The grand ambition of theorists studying ecology and evolution is to discover the logical and mathematical rules driving the world's biodiversity at every level from genetic diversity within species to differences between populations, communities, and ecosystems. This ambition has been difficult to realize in great part because of the complexity of biodiversity. Theoretical work has led to a complex web of theories, each having non-obvious consequences for other theories. Case in point, the recent realization that genetic diversity involves a great deal of temporal and spatial stochasticity forces theoretical population genetics to consider abiotic and biotic factors generally reserved to ecosystem ecology. This interconnectedness may require theoretical scientists to adopt new techniques adapted to reason about large sets of theories. Mathematicians have solved this problem by using formal languages based on logic to manage theorems. However, theories in ecology and evolution are not mathematical theorems, they involve uncertainty. Recent work in Artificial Intelligence in bridging logic and probability theory offers the opportunity to build rich knowledge bases that combine logic's ability to represent complex mathematical ideas with probability theory's ability to model uncertainty. We describe these hybrid languages and explore how they could be used to build a unified knowledge base of theories for ecology and evolution.},

abstract = {1. To predict the viability of populations, it is essential to clarify how performance depends both on large-scale environmental changes, such as climate warming, and on the local habitat. However, in spite of their potential importance, effects of interactions between large-scale environmental changes and the local environment on population viability have rarely been examined. 2. We investigated how population dynamics of the endangered alpine plant Dracocephalum austriacum depend on local habitat quality and climatic variation, as well as how effects of climate depend on local habitat. We used lasso regression shrinkage and integral projection models to identify effects on vital rates and population growth rates in seven populations over seven annual transitions. 3. Populations on steeper slopes had lower survival and stochastic population growth rate than populations on more gentle slopes. In years with low spring temperatures and high summer temperatures, survival and population growth rate were lower. In addition, the negative effects of high summer temperatures did depend on local habitat quality, being more negative in populations on steeper slopes. 4. Combining the net positive effects of high spring temperature and the net negative effects of high summer temperature on plant vital rates with predicted climate change over the next 30 years suggested that effects on D. austriacum would be relatively small. 5. Synthesis. Our results show that different aspects of a warmer climate may have opposing effects on populations, and that climatic effects may depend on local habitat quality. Such interactive effects should be accounted for when determining effects of large-scale environmental changes on population and community dynamics.},

abstract = {The reproductive success, growth, and mortality rates of tree species in the northern United States will be differentially affected by projected climate change over the next century. As a consequence, the spatial distributions of tree species will expand or contract at differential rates. In addition, human fragmentation of the landscape may limit effective seed dispersal, and inter-specific competition may limit the migration of climate-adapted species, restraining the rate of tree species migration. If the northward migration of tree species adapted to a warmer climate lags behind the rate of climatic change, overall growth rates and aboveground biomass of northern forests may be significantly reduced relative to their potential. We used a spatially interactive forest landscape model, LANDIS-II, that simulates tree species establishment, growth, mortality, succession, and disturbance. We simulated multiple scenarios of disturbance and climatic change across a ∼15 000 km2 forested landscape in northwestern Wisconsin, USA. These simulations were used to estimate changes in aboveground live biomass and the spatial distribution of 22 tree species. We observed a reduction in aboveground live biomass relative to the potential biomass for the combined soils and changing climate. We regressed the reduction of potential aboveground biomass against a measure of fragmentation, the initial biomass for 22 tree species, and soil water holding capacity calculated at 3 spatial resolutions. We also regressed the range expansion of 3 individual tree species that are expected to expand their distributions against the same variables. Species migration and range expansion were negatively correlated with fragmentation both in total and for 2 of the 3 species examined in detail. The initial abundances of some tree species were also significant predictors of species migration and range expansion and indicate significant competition between existing species assemblages and more southerly species that are expected to migrate north. In conclusion, the above-ground biomass of northern forests may be limited by interactions among climate change, interspecific competition, and fragmentation. {\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2008.},

abstract = {Climate change is driving latitudinal and altitudinal shifts in species distribution worldwide, leading to novel species assemblages. Lags between these biotic responses and contemporary climate changes have been reported for plants and animals. Theoretically, the magnitude of these lags should be greatest in lowland areas, where the velocity of climate change is expected to be much greater than that in highland areas. We compared temperature trends to temperatures reconstructed from plant assemblages (observed in 76,634 surveys) over a 44-year period in France (1965-2008). Here we report that forest plant communities had responded to 0.54 °C of the effective increase of 1.07 °C in highland areas (500-2,600 m above sea level), while they had responded to only 0.02 °C of the 1.11 °C warming trend in lowland areas. There was a larger temperature lag (by 3.1 times) between the climate and plant community composition in lowland forests than in highland forests. The explanation of such disparity lies in the following properties of lowland, as compared to highland, forests: the higher proportion of species with greater ability for local persistence as the climate warms, the reduced opportunity for short-distance escapes, and the greater habitat fragmentation. Although mountains are currently considered to be among the ecosystems most threatened by climate change (owing to mountaintop extinction), the current inertia of plant communities in lowland forests should also be noted, as it could lead to lowland biotic attrition.},

We screened over 5400 publications and identified 39 studies that quantified phenomenological intraspecific and interspecific interactions in terrestrial plant communities. Of the 67{\%} of species pairs in which both intra‐ and interspecific effects were negative (competitive), intraspecific competition was, on average, four to five‐fold stronger than interspecific competition. Of the remaining pairs, 93{\%} featured intraspecific competition and interspecific facilitation, a situation that stabilises coexistence. The difference between intra‐ and interspecific effects tended to be larger in observational than experimental data sets, in field than greenhouse studies, and in studies that quantified population growth over the full life cycle rather than single fitness components. Our results imply that processes promoting stable coexistence at local scales are common and consequential across terrestrial plant communities.},

Tout au long du XX{\`{e}}me si{\`{e}}cle, l'agrosyst{\`{e}}me cultiv{\'{e}} a {\'{e}}t{\'{e}} marqu{\'{e}} par des modifications profondes des syst{\`{e}}mes de culture dont le rythme s'est acc{\'{e}}l{\'{e}}r{\'{e}} durant les 50 derni{\`{e}}res ann{\'{e}}es avec l'adoption du d{\'{e}}sherbage chimique et la modification des rotations. En cons{\'{e}}quence, la composition et la diversit{\'{e}} des communaut{\'{e}}s adventices associ{\'{e}}es aux cultures annuelles ont {\'{e}}t{\'{e}} profond{\'{e}}ment modifi{\'{e}}es. Au-del{\`{a}} de la r{\'{e}}alisation de synth{\`{e}}ses nationales actualis{\'{e}}es par culture rendue possibles par le travail de collecte r{\'{e}}alis{\'{e}} sur diff{\'{e}}rents r{\'{e}}seaux d'observatoires, cette th{\`{e}}se poursuit deux objectifs sym{\'{e}}triques d'appliquer des concepts d'Ecologie (des communaut{\'{e}}s) pour analyser et interpr{\'{e}}ter les variations spatiales et temporelles de la flore adventice et d'utiliser le mod{\`{e}}le des communaut{\'{e}}s adventices pour tester des th{\'{e}}ories d'Ecologie. Les travaux pr{\'{e}}sent{\'{e}}s sont bas{\'{e}}s sur des donn{\'{e}}es r{\'{e}}colt{\'{e}}es {\`{a}} trois {\'{e}}chelles spatiales embo{\^{i}}t{\'{e}}es : le r{\'{e}}seau Biovigilance Flore couvrant toute la France, le r{\'{e}}seau ‘Barralis-Chadoeuf' couvrant la C{\^{o}}te-d'Or {\`{a}} 30 ann{\'{e}}es d'intervalle et le dispositif F{\'{e}}nay couvrant un paysage agricole. Les principaux r{\'{e}}sultats concernent : 1. Les r{\`{e}}gles d'assemblage des communaut{\'{e}}s adventices. Bien que fortement artificialis{\'{e}}es par l'agriculture, les communaut{\'{e}}s adventices ne forment pas un assemblage al{\'{e}}atoire d'esp{\`{e}}ces. Nous montrons que les principales variations dans la composition des communaut{\'{e}}s sont expliqu{\'{e}}es dans l'ordre : i) par le type de culture en fonction de la date de semis opposant les cultures d'hiver aux cultures de printemps, ii) par les conditions p{\'{e}}do-climatiques, opposant la flore des sols argilo-calcaires des r{\'{e}}gions s{\`{e}}ches {\`{a}} la flore des sols siliceux acides des r{\'{e}}gions {\`{a}} plus forte pluviom{\'{e}}trie et iii) par un gradient latitudinal opposant la flore thermophile m{\'{e}}diterran{\'{e}}enne {\`{a}} la flore eurosib{\'{e}}rienne. L'effet ‘type de culture' se d{\'{e}}compose en deux types de contraintes principales : ‘date de semis' et ‘herbicides', qui induisent une convergence de traits. Les autres techniques culturales (travail du sol) pr{\'{e}}sentent un pouvoir discriminant plus faible. Globalement, le poids direct de l'homme est plus important que celui du milieu aux {\'{e}}chelles consid{\'{e}}r{\'{e}}es. 2. Les changements de flore depuis les ann{\'{e}}es 1970. En 30 ans, l'intensit{\'{e}} du renouvellement (‘turnover') parmi les esp{\`{e}}ces les plus communes varie du simple (bl{\'{e}} d'hiver 33{\%}) au double (ma{\"{i}}s 61{\%}) mais reste dans tous les cas tr{\`{e}}s sup{\'{e}}rieur aux turnovers observ{\'{e}}s au cours des successions dans les {\'{e}}cosyst{\`{e}}mes ‘naturels'. La signification {\'{e}}cologique des changements constat{\'{e}}s a {\'{e}}t{\'{e}} interpr{\'{e}}t{\'{e}}e en fonction des caract{\'{e}}ristiques biologiques et/ou {\'{e}}cologiques des esp{\`{e}}ces (traits fonctionnels, valeurs indicatrices d'Ellenberg, indices de sp{\'{e}}cialisation {\`{a}} une culture). Un premier cas d'{\'{e}}tude concerne les changements au sein des esp{\`{e}}ces adventices majeures de la culture du tournesol. Le classement des esp{\`{e}}ces en groupes fonctionnels montre qu'un seul groupe sur les cinq identifi{\'{e}}s rassemble la quasi-totalit{\'{e}} des esp{\`{e}}ces en progression. Les caract{\'{e}}ristiques li{\'{e}}es {\`{a}} ce groupe fonctionnel montre qu'une des clefs pour r{\'{e}}ussir dans cette culture est de poss{\'{e}}der un panel {\'{e}}tendu parmi les traits mim{\'{e}}tiques de la culture : tol{\'{e}}rance aux herbicides, forte comp{\'{e}}titivit{\'{e}} (nitrophilie, grande taille), h{\'{e}}liophilie, etc. Un deuxi{\`{e}}me cas d'{\'{e}}tude porte sur l'{\'{e}}volution de la composition des communaut{\'{e}}s en C{\^{o}}te-d'Or. Un index de classification des esp{\`{e}}ces en fonction de l'amplitude de leur niche {\'{e}}cologique montre que le ratio g{\'{e}}n{\'{e}}ralistes/sp{\'{e}}cialistes a significativement augment{\'{e}} sauf vis-{\`{a}}-vis de la culture du colza dont les surfaces ont augment{\'{e}} (+ 800 {\%} depuis 1970). 3. Le d{\'{e}}clin de la biodiversit{\'{e}} dans les agrosyst{\`{e}}mes cultiv{\'{e}}s. L'{\'{e}}tude diachronique men{\'{e}}e sur 158 parcelles en C{\^{o}}te-d'Or montre qu'au cours des 30 derni{\`{e}}res ann{\'{e}}es, l'{\'{e}}volution des communaut{\'{e}}s adventices est marqu{\'{e}}e par une baisse de 44{\%} la richesse sp{\'{e}}cifique et de 67{\%} de l'abondance des esp{\`{e}}ces dans les parcelles. Les variations spatiales de la diversit{\'{e}} {\`{a}} l'{\'{e}}chelle de la France indique que cette baisse de diversit{\'{e}} pourrait d{\'{e}}couler de l'intensification incluant l'augmentation de la taille des parcelles et la disparition des haies {\`{a}} travers les remembrements, la r{\'{e}}gression de l'{\'{e}}levage et des syst{\`{e}}mes extensifs associ{\'{e}}s, l'utilisation accrue des herbicides et l'enrichissement des sols oligotrophes. Contrairement {\`{a}} ce qui {\'{e}}tait attendu, l'intensification de l'agriculture n'a cependant pas conduit {\`{a}} une homog{\'{e}}n{\'{e}}isation de la composition des communaut{\'{e}}s. Si des esp{\`{e}}ces sp{\'{e}}cialistes de conditions {\'{e}}cologiques particuli{\`{e}}res ont poursuivi leur d{\'{e}}clin, le poids de ce processus n'est pas significatif par rapport aux processus d'extinction des esp{\`{e}}ces les plus communes initialement pr{\'{e}}sentes dans de nombreuses parcelles. A l'{\'{e}}chelle r{\'{e}}gionale le nombre d'esp{\`{e}}ces reste stable. L'importance du d{\'{e}}clin de la biodiversit{\'{e}} floristique dans les champs cultiv{\'{e}}s n'est pas sans cons{\'{e}}quence sur la fonctionnalit{\'{e}} des communaut{\'{e}}s adventices (diminution de la diversit{\'{e}} fonctionnelle, forte r{\'{e}}gression d'esp{\`{e}}ces servant de ressource aux oiseaux, d{\'{e}}clin des esp{\`{e}}ces entomogames). Le poids des bords de champs dans la distribution de la diversit{\'{e}} {\`{a}} l'{\'{e}}chelle d'un paysage agricole est {\'{e}}valu{\'{e}} et leur r{\^{o}}le dans la conservation des esp{\`{e}}ces en d{\'{e}}clin est discut{\'{e}}. Les communaut{\'{e}}s adventices se sont av{\'{e}}r{\'{e}}es de bons mod{\`{e}}les pour tester les th{\'{e}}ories d'Ecologie en particulier concernant l'{\'{e}}volution contrast{\'{e}}e des esp{\`{e}}ces g{\'{e}}n{\'{e}}ralistes versus sp{\'{e}}cialistes face {\`{a}} l'h{\'{e}}t{\'{e}}rog{\'{e}}n{\'{e}}it{\'{e}} (temporelle) de l'habitat et la d{\'{e}}finition des r{\`{e}}gles d'assemblage {\`{a}} partir de la relation entre filtres environnementaux et traits des esp{\`{e}}ces.},

Climate change is shifting ranges and altering forest productivity. Disturbance regimes are changing with the potential for novel interactions among disturbance types. In some areas, forest management practices are intensifying, whereas in other areas, lower-impact ecological methods are being used. Interactions among these changing factors are likely to alter ecosystem structure and function at regional to continental scales. A macrosystems approach is essential to assessing the broadscale impacts of these changes and quantify cross-scale interactions, emergent patterns, and feedbacks. A promising line of analysis is the assimilation of data with ecosystem models to scale processes to the macrosystem and generate projections based on alternative scenarios. Analyses of these projections can characterize the range of future variability in forest function and provide information to guide policy, industry, and science in a changing world.},

abstract = {The neotropical Atlantic Forest supports one of the highest degrees of species richness and rates of endemism on the planet, but has also undergone a huge forest loss. However, there exists no broad-scale information about the spatial distribution of its remnants that could guide conservation actions, especially when systematic biodiversity data are not available. In this context, our objectives were to quantify how much of the forest still remains, and analyze its spatial distribution. We considered the entire Brazilian Atlantic Forest, and eight sub-regions, defined according to species distribution. The results revealed a serious situation: more than 80{\%} of the fragments are {\textless}50 ha, almost half the remaining forest is {\textless}100 m from its edges, the average distance between fragments is large (1440 m), and nature reserves protect only 9{\%} of the remaining forest and 1{\%} of the original forest. On the other hand, our estimates of existing Atlantic Forest cover were higher than previous ones (7–8{\%}), ranging from 11.4{\%} to 16{\%}. The differences among estimates are mainly related to our inclusion of intermediate secondary forests and small fragments ({\textless}100 ha), which correspond to approximately 32–40{\%} of what remains. We suggest some guidelines for conservation: (i) large mature forest fragments should be a conservation priority; (ii) smaller fragments can be managed in order to maintain functionally linked mosaics; (iii) the matrix surrounding fragments should be managed so as to minimize edge effects and improve connectivity; and (iv) restoration actions should be taken, particularly in certain key areas. The clear differences in the amount remaining and its spatial distribution within each sub-region must be considered when planning for biodiversity conservation.},

abstract = {s Abstract The focus of most ideas on diversity maintenance is species coexis-tence, which may be stable or unstable. Stable coexistence can be quantified by the long-term rates at which community members recover from low density. Quantifica-tion shows that coexistence mechanisms function in two major ways: They may be (a) equalizing because they tend to minimize average fitness differences between species, or (b) stabilizing because they tend to increase negative intraspecific inter-actions relative to negative interspecific interactions. Stabilizing mechanisms are es-sential for species coexistence and include traditional mechanisms such as resource partitioning and frequency-dependent predation, as well as mechanisms that depend on fluctuations in population densities and environmental factors in space and time. Equalizing mechanisms contribute to stable coexistence because they reduce large average fitness inequalities which might negate the effects of stabilizing mechanisms. Models of unstable coexitence, in which species diversity slowly decays over time, have focused almost exclusively on equalizing mechanisms. These models would be more robust if they also included stabilizing mechanisms, which arise in many and varied ways but need not be adequate for full stability of a system. Models of unstable coex-istence invite a broader view of diversity maintenance incorporating species turnover.},

abstract = {Aim: The aim was to examine whether recent mortality can be explained by hydraulic failure linked to water deficit. Location: Western Europe. Time period: 1986–2014. Major taxa studied: Forty-four tree species. Methods: We modelled the hydraulic safety margin (HSM) across the ranges of 44 tree species at their driest margin (n = 193,261 plots), defined as the difference between the estimated minimal soil water potential of each plot and the species water stress threshold, which corresponds to the hydraulic failure of the vascular system. Soil water potential was estimated by applying Campbell's equations on the minimal and maximal soil water contents estimated from 1979 to 2010 in the top 289 cm of soil and five soil textures across the species ranges. For each species, we modelled the amount of average mortality derived from plots of the Spanish and French National Forest Inventories to the variation in modelled hydraulic safety margin and environmental drivers across the species ranges using hurdle models. Results: We did not identify any global convergence of modelled HSM within the species distribution ranges, finding instead a rather large variability in modelled HSM for most of the studied species. Fifteen species, out of 25 for which the models were practicable, showed significantly higher mortality in populations with negative HSM in comparison to those showing positive HSM, with positive and negative interaction along the aridity index. Main conclusions: The combination of competition, average climate and modelled HSM explained average tree mortality. Most of the species presented at least one population that had already experienced a negative HSM and many other populations a positive but narrow HSM, suggesting that climate change is likely to push some populations towards a higher risk of hydraulic failure in the drier conditions projected for Western Europe.},

abstract = {Several species of Araucaria and Agathis (Arau- cariaceae) occur as canopy emergents in rain forests of the western pacific region, often representing major components of total stand biomass. New data from permanent forest plots (and other published work) for three species (Araucaria hunsteinii from New Guinea, A. laubenfelsii from New Cal- edonia, and Agathis australis from New Zealand) are used to test the validity of the temporal stand replacement model proposed by Ogden (1985) and Ogden {\&} Stewart (1995) to explain the structural and compositional properties of New Zealand rain forests containing the conifer Agathis australis. Here we propose the model as a general one which explains the stand dynamics of rain forests with Araucariaceae across a range of sites and species in the western Pacific. Forest stands representing putative stages in the model were examined for changes through time in species recruit- ment, growth and survivorship, and stand richness, density and basal area. Support for the model was found on the basis of: 1. Evidence for a phase of massive conifer recruitment following landscape-scale disturbances (e.g. by fire at the Huapai site, New Zealand for Agathis australis); 2. Increasing species richness of angiosperm trees in the pole stage of forest stand development (i.e. as the initial cohort of conifers reach tree size; {\textgreater} 10 cm DBH); 3. A high turnover rate for angiosperms ({\textless} 100 yr), and low turnover for conifers ({\textgreater}{\textgreater} 100 yr) in the pole stage, but similar turnover rates for both components (50 - 100 yr) as forests enter the mature to senescent phase for the initial conifer cohort; 4. Very low rates of recruitment for conifers within mature stands, and projected forest compositions which show increasing dominance by angiosperm tree species; 5. A low probability of conifer recruitment in large canopy gaps created by conifer tree falls during the initial cohort senescent phase, which could produce a second generation low density stand in the absence of landscape scale disturbance; 6. Evi- dence that each of the three species examined required open canopy conditions (canopy openness {\textgreater} 10 {\%}) for successful recruitment. The evidence presented here supports the temporal stand replacement model, but more long-term supporting data are needed, especially for the phase immediately following land- scape level disturbance.},

abstract = {This paper reviews the current knowledge on weed seed movement in an agricultural environment. Seed movement is analyzed both from an agronomic and ecological perspective, focusing predominantly on horizontal seed movement. Abiotic (anemochory and hydrochory), as well as biotic (autochory, myrmecochory, epizoochory, and endozoochory) weed seed dispersal typologies are examined, highlighting the mechanisms involved, the specializations displayed by weed species that have evolved by exploiting a particular dispersal mechanism, and their adaptive interaction with the surrounding ecosystem. Emphasis is also placed on the crucial role of human activity (anthropochory), which can affect natural (biotic and abiotic) weed seed dispersal at several stages, partly via the worldwide commercial seed trade but, above all, by crop management operations, thereby potentially facilitating the entry and spread of alien weed species. This phenomenon, together with the invasive expansion of existing weeds that more successfully coevolve and adapt to the new environment, might exert an adverse effect on biodiversity. In-depth knowledge of weed seed dispersal, survival, and germination mechanisms is therefore essential for effective and eco-compatible management of the weed phytocoenoses present in the agroecosystem in order to promote a rational trade-off between agricultural productivity and environmental protection.},

As sessile long-living plants, they need this high level of genetic variation for adaptation to highly variable environmental conditions. A set of population genetic processes such as the mating system, gene flow, selection, and migration determine the genetic composition of a tree population. First we will give an introduction and overview on the most important processes and their impact on the genetic diversity of tropical trees, and then we will go in more details for some of the processes. The genetic diversity is of fundamental function for the stability of forest ecosystems. Thus adequate measures on gene conservation are very important. We will cover this topic with a specific chapter. More recently with the advance of genomics and molecular genetics, we have a broad set of molecular markers in hand for diagnostic purposes. We highlight as one important application the use of gene markers and DNA bar coding for tree species identification and as a tool to fight against illegal logging.

abstract = {Aim: The aim was to examine whether recent mortality can be explained by hydraulic failure linked to water deficit. Location: Western Europe. Time period: 1986–2014. Major taxa studied: Forty-four tree species. Methods: We modelled the hydraulic safety margin (HSM) across the ranges of 44 tree species at their driest margin (n = 193,261 plots), defined as the difference between the estimated minimal soil water potential of each plot and the species water stress threshold, which corresponds to the hydraulic failure of the vascular system. Soil water potential was estimated by applying Campbell's equations on the minimal and maximal soil water contents estimated from 1979 to 2010 in the top 289 cm of soil and five soil textures across the species ranges. For each species, we modelled the amount of average mortality derived from plots of the Spanish and French National Forest Inventories to the variation in modelled hydraulic safety margin and environmental drivers across the species ranges using hurdle models. Results: We did not identify any global convergence of modelled HSM within the species distribution ranges, finding instead a rather large variability in modelled HSM for most of the studied species. Fifteen species, out of 25 for which the models were practicable, showed significantly higher mortality in populations with negative HSM in comparison to those showing positive HSM, with positive and negative interaction along the aridity index. Main conclusions: The combination of competition, average climate and modelled HSM explained average tree mortality.

The integration of biogeography and network theory will yield important results and further our understanding of species interactions. It has, however, been hampered so far by the difficulty to quantify variation among interaction networks. Here, we propose a general framework to study the dissimilarity of species interaction networks over time, space or environments, allowing both the use of quantitative and qualitative data. We decompose network dissimilarity into interactions and species turnover components, so that it is immediately comparable to common measures of {\$}\beta{\$}-diversity. We emphasise that scaling up {\$}\beta{\$}-diversity of community composition to the {\$}\beta{\$}-diversity of interactions requires only a small methodological step, which we foresee will help empiricists adopt this method. We illustrate the framework with a large dataset of hosts and parasites interactions and highlight other possible usages. We discuss a research agenda towards a biogeographical theory of species interactions.},

Nonnative species introductions have greatly increased plant species richness in many regions of the world at the same time that they have led to the creation of new hybrid polyploid species by bringing pre-viously isolated congeners into close contact. At the local scale, conversion of primary vegetation to agriculture has decreased plant diversity, whereas other drivers of change—e.g., climate warming, habitat fragmentation, and nitrogen deposition—have highly context-dependent effects, resulting in a distribution of temporal trends with a mean close to zero.

abstract = {With climate change, favorable growing conditions for tree species are shifting northwards and to higher altitudes. Therefore, local populations are becoming less adapted to their environment. Assisted migration is one of the proposed adaptive measures to reduce the vulnerability of natural populations and maintain forest productivity. It consists of moving genetic material to a territory where future climate conditions correspond to those of its current location. Eight white spruce (Picea glauca [Moench] Voss) seed sources representing as many seed orchards were planted in 2013 at three forest sites simulating a south-north climatic gradient of 1.7°C in Qu{\'{e}}bec, Canada. The objectives were to (1) evaluate the morpho-physiological responses of the different seed sources and (2) determine the role of genetic adaptation and physiological plasticity on the observed variation in morpho-physiological traits. Various seedling characteristics were measured, notably height growth from nursery to the fourth year on plantation. Other traits such as biomass and carbon allocation, nutritional status, and various photosynthetic traits before bud break, were evaluated during the fourth growing season. No interaction between sites and seed sources was observed for any traits, suggesting similar plasticity between seed sources. There was no change in the rank of seed sources and sites between years for height growth. Moreover, a significant positive correlation was observed between the height from the nursery and that after 4 years in the plantation. Southern seed sources showed the best height growth, while optimum growth was observed at the central site. Juvenile height growth seems to be a good indicator of the juvenile carbon sequestration and could serve as a selection criterion for the best genetics sources for carbon sequestration. Vector analysis showed no nitrogen deficiency 4 years after planting. Neither seed sources nor planting sites had a significant effect on photosynthesis before bud break. The observed results during the establishment phase under different site conditions indicate that southern seed sources may already benefit from assisted migration to cooler climatic conditions further north. While northern seed sources are likely to benefit from anticipated local global warming, they would not match the growth performance of seedlings from southern sources.},

abstract = {A spatial and mechanistic model is developed for the dynamics of transition oak-northern hardwoods forests in northeastern North America. The purpose of the model is to extrapolate from measurable fine-scale and short-term interactions among individual trees to large-scale and long-term dynamics of forest communities. Field methods, statistical estimators, and model structure were designed simultaneously to ensure that parameters could be estimated from data collected in the field. This paper documents eight aspects of a three-year study to calibrate, test, and analyze the model for the nine dominant and subdominant tree species in transition oak-northern hardwoods forests: 1) Design and structure of the model. The model makes population dynamic forecasts by predicting the fate of every individual tree throughout its life. Species-specific functions predict each tree's dispersal, establishment, growth, mortality, and fecundity. Trees occupy unique spatial positions, and individual performance is affected by the local availability of resources. Competition is mechanistic: resources available to each tree are reduced by neighbors. Although the model was developed to include light, water, and nitrogen, the version described here includes only competition for light (shading and light-dependent performance) because the field data provide little evidence of competition for nitrogen and water over the range of sites examined. 2) Estimates of the model's parameters for each species. The estimates reveal a variety of "strategic trade-offs" among the species. For example, species that grow quickly under high light tend to cast relatively little shade, have low survivorship under low light, and have high dispersal. In contrast, species that grow slowly under high light tend to cast relatively dark shade, and to have high survivorship under low light and low dispersal. These trade-offs define one of two dominant "axes" of strategic variation. 3) Community level predictions of the model. The model predicts succession from early dominance by species such as Quercux rubra and Prunus serotina, to late dominance by Fagus grandifolia and Tsuga canadensis, with Betula alleganiensis present as a gap phase species in old-growth stands. The model also predicts that old-growth communities will have intraspecifically clumped and interspecifically segregated spatial distributions. 4) An error analysis that identifies community level predictions that are robust given the level of sampling uncertainty in the study. This analysis translates the statistical uncertainty associated with each parameter estimate into statistical uncertainty in the model's predictions. The robust predictions include those mentioned in aspect (3) above. 5) Sensitivity of the model to changes in initial conditions and to changes in the three parameters not included in the error analysis. For example, the model predicts that initial abundances continue to affect community composition well into succession ({\textgreater}300 yr for some species). 6) Tests of the system- and community-level predictions of the model against independent data gleaned from other studies. These tests support the predictions found to be robust in the error analysis, including those predictions mentioned in aspect (3) above. 7) Modeling experiments that determine which aspects of individual performance and inter-neighbor competition are responsible for each of the robust predictions identified in aspect (4) above and tested in aspect (6) above. This analysis reveals a wide variety of causal relationships, with most parameters contributing to at least one community level phenomenon. 8) An explanation of the diversity of individual level causes identified in aspect (7). The two "axes" describing most of the strategic variation among the species (see [2]), provide a simple explanation of community level pattern in terms of individual level processes.},

abstract = {The principle of ecological succession bear importantly on the relationships between man and nature. The framework of successional theory needs to be examined as a basis for resolving man's present environmental crisis. Most ideas pertaining to the development of ecological systems are based on descriptive data obtained by observing changes in biotic communities over long periods, or on highly theoretical assumptions; very few of the generally accepterd hypotheses have been tested experimentally. Some of the confusion, vagueness and lack of experimental work in this area stems from the tendency of ecologiusts to regard "succession" as a single straitforward idea; in actual fact, it entails an interacting complex of processes, some of which counteract one another.},

abstract = {Aim: Dynamic range models are proposed to investigate species distributions and to project range shifts under climate change. They are based upon the Hutchinsonian niche theory, specifying that the occurrence of a species in an environmental space should be limited to positions where the intrinsic growth rate is positive. Evaluating population growth rate is, however, difficult for physiologically structured populations, such as forest stands, owing to size-induced individual variation in performance. Therefore, we still have a limited understanding of which aspect of tree demography contributes the most to their geographical range limit. We develop an index of demographic performance for size-structured populations and study its variation across a climatic gradient. We then investigate the relationship between the demographic performance index and species distribution. Location: North America (57–124° W, 26–52° N). Time period: 1963–2010. Major taxa studied: Fourteen tree species. Methods: We represent forest dynamics with a size-structured population model and neighbourhood competition with the perfect plasticity approximation. We then derive the lifetime reproduction per individual, (Formula presented.), in the absence of density dependence. Using forest inventory data, we assess how tree demography for each species varies with climate. We test the model by comparing (Formula presented.) and the probability of occurrence within species ranges. Results: We find that both growth and mortality rates vary across species distributions, but climate explains little of the observed variation. Individual size and neighbourhood competition are the primary explanatory variables of tree demography. Finally, we find that (Formula presented.) relates weakly to the probability of occurrence, with no systematic decline in population growth rates towards the range limits. Main conclusions: Spatial and size-induced variation in tree growth and mortality do not explain range limits and are insufficient to enable an understanding of tree dynamics. We propose that phenomena perceived mostly at the metapopulation scale should also be considered.},

Predictions based on the Lozenge regeneration model were established in order to determine if this model could predict changes in the species' population dynamics: (1) the established individuals exhibit long persistence and (2) seedling and sapling abundance, as well as population descriptors, should exhibit behaviour that indicates one of the stages prescribed by the model. All A. angustifolia individuals were evaluated within a 5.1 ha plot at the study site over a six-year period. Lefkovitch's transition model was used and population descriptors were calculated.

abstract = {'Filtering', or the reduction in species diversity that occurs because not all species can persist in all locations, is thought to unfold hierarchically, controlled by the environment at large scales and competition at small scales. However, the ecological effects of competition and the environment are not independent, and observational approaches preclude investigation into their interplay. We use a demographic approach with 30 plant species to experimentally test: (i) the effect of competition on species persistence in two soil moisture environments, and (ii) the effect of environmental conditions on mechanisms underlying competitive coexistence. We find that competitors cause differential species persistence across environments even when effects are lacking in the absence of competition, and that the traits which determine persistence depend on the competitive environment. If our study had been observational and trait-based, we would have erroneously concluded that the environment filters species with low biomass, shallow roots and small seeds. Changing environmental conditions generated idiosyncratic effects on coexistence outcomes, increasing competitive exclusion of some species while promoting coexistence of others. Our results highlight the importance of considering environmental filtering in the light of, rather than in isolation from, competition, and challenge community assembly models and approaches to projecting future species distributions.},

abstract = {In this analysis, we attempt to understand how monoecy and dioecy drive spatial genetic structure (SGS) in plant populations. For this purpose, plants of the genus Ficus were used as a comparative model due to their particular characteristics, including high species diversity, variation in life histories, and sexual systems. One of the main issues we assessed is whether dioecious fig tree populations are more spatially genetically structured than monoecious populations. Using the Sp statistic, which allows for quantitative comparisons among different studies, we compared the extent of SGS between monoecious and dioecious Ficus species. To broaden our conclusions we used published data on an additional 27 monoecious and dioecious plant species. Furthermore, genetic diversity analyses were performed for two monoecious Ficus species using 12 microsatellite markers in order to strengthen our conclusions about SGS. Our results show that dioecy, more than monoecy, significantly contributes to SGS in plant populations. On average, the estimate of Sp was six times higher for dioecious Ficus species than monoecious Ficus species and it was two times higher in dioecious than monoecious plant species. Considering these results, we emphasize that the long-distance pollen dispersal mechanism in monoecious Ficus species seems to be the dominant factor in determining weak spatial genetic structure, high levels of genetic diversity, and lack of inbreeding. Although Ficus constitute a model species to study SGS, a more general comparison encompassing a wider range of plants is required in order to better understand how sexual systems affect genetic structure.},

abstract = {Many western North American forest types have experienced considerable changes in ecosystem structure, composition, and function as a result of both fire exclusion and timber harvesting. These two influences co-occurred over a large portion of dry forests making it difficult to know the strength of either one on its own or the potential for an interaction between the two. In this study we used contemporary re-measurements of a systematic historical forest inventory to investigate forest change in the Sierra Nevada. The historical data opportunistically spanned a significant land management agency boundary, which protected part of the inventory area from timber harvesting. This allowed for a robust comparison of forest change between logged and unlogged areas. In addition, we assessed the effects of recent management activities aimed at forest restoration relative to the same areas historically, and to other areas without recent management. Based on analyses of 22,007 trees (historical: 9573; contemporary: 12,434) live basal area and tree density significantly increased from 1911 to present in both logged and unlogged areas. Both shrub cover and the proportion of live basal area occupied by pine species declined from 1911 to present in both areas, but statistical significance was inconsistent. The most notable difference between logged and unlogged areas was in the density of large trees, which declined significantly in logged areas, but was unchanged in unlogged areas. Recent management activities had a varied impact on the forest structure and composition variables analyzed. In general, areas with no recent management activities experienced the greatest change from 1911 to present. If approximating historical forest conditions is a land management goal the documented changes in forest structure and composition from 1911 to present indicate that active restoration, including fire use and mechanical thinning, is needed in many areas.},

A greenhouse experiment was conducted to study the effect of drought stress on grain growth and yield of barley. Plants were exposed to three drought treatments at the beginning of grain filling: (1) well-watered at 100{\%} field capacity, (2) mild drought stress at 60{\%} field capacity, and (3) severe drought stress at 20{\%} field capacity until grain maturity. Grain moisture content and dry weight were determined for grains harvested at 3, 10, 17, 23 and 31 days after the beginning of grain filling. Grain dry weight for severe drought stress plants reached a maximum value earlier than grains from mild drought stress and well-watered plants, indicating that grains from severe drought stress plants had a higher growth rate than those of mild drought stress and well-watered plants. Drought-stressed plants had shorter duration of grain filling than well-watered plants. Drought stress treatments reduced grain yield by reducing the number of tillers, spikes and grains per plant and individual grain weight. In conclusion, postanthesis drought stress was detrimental to grain yield regardless of the stress severity. Hordeum},

abstract = {The positive relationship between spatial environmental heterogeneity and species diversity is a widely accepted concept, generally associated with niche limitation. However, niche limitation cannot account for negative heterogeneity-diversity relationships (HDR) revealed in several case studies. Here we explore how HDR varies at different spatial scales and provide novel theories for small-scale species co-existence that explain both positive and negative HDR. At large spatial scales of heterogeneity (e.g. landscape level), different communities co-exist, promoting large regional species pool size and resulting in positive HDR. At smaller scales within communities, species co-existence can be enhanced by increasing the number of different patches, as predicted by the niche limitation theory, or alternatively, restrained by heterogeneity. We conducted meta-regressions for experimental and observational HDR studies, and found that negative HDRs are significantly more common at smaller spatial scales. We propose three theories to account for niche limitation at small spatial scales. (1) Microfragmentation theory: with increasing spatial heterogeneity, large homogeneous patches lose area and become isolated, which in turn restrains the establishment of new plant individuals and populations, thus reducing species richness. (2) Heterogeneity confounded by mean: when heterogeneity occurs at spatial scales smaller than the size of individual plants, which forage through the patches, species diversity can be either positively or negatively affected by a change in the mean of an environmental factor. (3) Heterogeneity as a separate niche axis: the ability of species to tolerate heterogeneity at spatial scales smaller than plant size varies, affecting HDR. We conclude that processes other than niche limitation can affect the relationship between heterogeneity and diversity.},

If different species respond most to resources that are limiting at different times, then those differences may trade off with other trophic or life-history traits that, together, help to maintain diversity. The statistical models used to infer trophic differences do not accommodate uncertainty in resources and variability in how individuals use resources. We provide hierarchical models for resource-growth responses that accommodate stochasticity in parameters and in data, despite the fact that causes are typically unknown. A complex joint posterior distribution taken over {\textgreater} 102 parameters is readily integrated to provide a comprehensive accounting of uncertainty in the growth response, together with a small number of hyperparameters that summarize the population response. An application involving seedling growth response to light availability shows that large trophic differences among species suggested by traditional models can be an artifact of the assumption that all individuals respond identically. The hierarchical analysis indicates broad trophic overlap, with the implication that slow dynamics play a more important role in preserving diversity than is widely believed.},

Ecological mechanisms underlying these impacts are well studied, but the role of evolutionary processes is rarely assessed.

We re-assembled communities with 8- year co-selection history adjacent to communities with identical species composition but no his- tory of co-selection (‘na€ ıve communities'). Monocultures, and in particular mixtures of two to four co-selected species, were more productive than their corresponding na€ ıve communities over 4 years in soils with or without co-selected microbial communities. At the highest diversity level of eight plant species, no such differences were observed. Our findings suggest that plant commu- nity evolution can lead to rapid increases in ecosystem functioning at low diversity but may take longer at high diversity.

abstract = {Assessing the perception of key stakeholders within the forest sector is critical to evaluating their readiness to engage in adapting to climate change. Here, we report the results of the most comprehensive survey carried out in the Canadian forestry sector to date regarding perceptions of climate change. A total of 1158 individuals, representing a wide range of stakeholders across the five most important forestry provinces in Canada, were asked about climate change, its impact on forest ecosystems, and the suitability of current forest management for addressing future impacts. Overall, we found that respondents were more concerned about climate change than the general population. More than 90{\%} of respondents agreed with the anthropogenic origins of climate change, and {\textgreater} 50{\%} considered it a direct threat to their welfare. Political view was the main driver of general beliefs about the causes of climate change and its future consequences, while the province of origin proved to be the best predictor of perceived current impacts on forest ecosystems and its associated risks; and type of stakeholder was the main driver of perceived need for adaptation. Industrial stakeholders were the most skeptical about the anthropogenic cause(s) of climate change (18{\%} disagreed with this statement, compared to an average of 8{\%} in the other stakeholders), its impacts on forest ecosystems (28{\%} for industry vs. 10{\%} for other respondents), and the need for new management practices (18{\%} vs. 7{\%}). Although the degree of awareness and the willingness to implement adaptive practices were high even for the most skeptical groups, our study identified priority sectors or areas for action when designing awareness campaigns. We suggest that the design of a strategic framework for implementing climate adaptation within the Canadian forest sector should focus on the relationship between climate change and changes in disturbance regimes, and above all on the economic consequences of these changes, but it should also take into account the positions shown by each of the actors in each province.},

abstract = {Questions: What was the tree species composition of forests prior to European settlement at the northern hardwood range limit in eastern Qu´ebec, Canada? What role did human activities play in the changes in forest composition in this region? Location: Northern range limit of northern hardwoods in the Lower St. Lawrence region of eastern Qu´ebec, Canada. Methods: We used early land survey records (1846–1949) of public lands to reconstruct pre-settlement forest composition. The data consist of ranked tree species enumerations at points or for segments along surveyed lines, with enumerations of forest cover types and notes concerning disturbances. An original procedure was developed to weigh and combine these differing data types (line versus point observations; taxa versus cover enumerations). Change to present-day forest composition was evaluated by comparing survey records with forest decadal surveys conducted by the government of Qu´ebec over the last 30 years (1980–2009). Results: Pre-settlement dominance of conifers was strong and uniform across the study area, whereas dominance of maple and birches was patchy. Cedar and spruce were less likely to dominate with increasing altitude, whereas maple displayed the reverse trend. Frequency of disturbances, especially logging and fire, increased greatly after 1900. Comparison of survey records and modern plots showed general increases for maple (mentioned frequency increased by 39{\%}), poplar (36{\%}) and paper birch (31{\%}). Considering only taxa ranked first by surveyors, cedar displayed the largest decrease (19{\%}), whereas poplar (15{\%}) and maple (9{\%}) increased significantly. Conclusions: These changes in forest composition can be principally attributed to clear-cutting and colonization fire disturbances throughout the 20th century, and mostly reflected the propensity of taxa to expand (maples/aspen) or decline (cedar/spruce) with increased disturbance frequency. Qu´ebec's land survey archives provide an additional data source to reconstruct and validate our knowledge of North America's pre-settlement temperate and sub-boreal forests.},

If different species respond most to resources that are limiting at different times, then those differences may trade off with other trophic or life-history traits that, together, help to maintain diversity. The statistical models used to infer trophic differences do not accommodate uncertainty in resources and variability in how individuals use resources. We provide hierarchical models for resource-growth responses that accommodate stochasticity in parameters and in data, despite the fact that causes are typically unknown. A complex joint posterior distribution taken over {\textgreater} 102 parameters is readily integrated to provide a comprehensive accounting of uncertainty in the growth response, together with a small number of hyperparameters that summarize the population response. An application involving seedling growth response to light availability shows that large trophic differences among species suggested by traditional models can be an artifact of the assumption that all individuals respond identically. The hierarchical analysis indicates broad trophic overlap, with the implication that slow dynamics play a more important role in preserving diversity than is widely believed.},

abstract = {The fitness concept of evolutionary ecology differs from that of population genetics. The former is geared toward dealing with long-term evolution through the repeated invasion of mutants for potentially complicated ecological scenarios, the latter with short-term changes in relative frequencies of types for heavily simplified ecological scenarios. After a discussion of the conditions allowing for the definition of a general invasion fitness concept, among which is that reproduction should be clonal, a framework is built within which the definition can be formalized. Recipes are given for calculating (proxies for) fitness in a large variety of instances. The main use of invasion fitness is in ESS calculations. Only under ecologically very special conditions ESSs can be calculated from optimization principles. These conditions are detailed, as well as the even more special conditions under which evolution maximizes r or R0. The invasion fitness concept extends to any aggregates treatable as metaindividuals. Individual- and metaindividual-level invasion fitnesses coincide when the latter is larger than per capita within aggregate growth. Calculating invasion fitness through a metaindividual route often works beyond calculations based on inclusive fitness arguments, but provides less insight. Mendelian diploids are aggregates of clonally reproducing genes. Conditions are given for when predictions for virtual cloning diploids coincide with those from gene-based calculations.},

A key assumption of this conceptualization is that all individuals inside a box are functionally equivalent. Demographic stage structure, however, is a widespread source of heterogeneity inside the boxes. Synthesizing recent studies, we show that stage structure can modify the dynamics of consumer-resource communities owing to stage-related shifts in the nature and strength of interactions that occur within and between populations. As a consequence, stage structure can stabilize consumer-resource dynamics, create possibilities for alternative community states, modify conditions for coexistence of competitors, and alter the strength and direction of trophic cascades. Consideration of stage structure can thus lead to outcomes that are not expected based on unstructured approaches. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {We present a theory extending the source-sink concept with an ecosystem perspective. We analyze a model for meta-ecosystem dynamics in a heterogeneous environment to study how the spatial flows of materials such as inorganic nutrients and nutrients sequestered into producers, herbivores, and detritus affect the community dynamics. We show that spatial flows of an inorganic nutrient (direct nutrient flow) and organic matter (indirect nutrient flow) through detritus, producer, or herbivore compartments can reverse the source-sink dynamics of a local ecosystem. More precisely, the balance between such direct and indirect nutrient flows determines the net direction of nutrient flows ties. It allows a sink to turn into a source and vice versa. This effect of nutrient flows on sobetween two ecosystems of contrasted productiviurce and sink dynamics is robust to the ecosystem structure (with and without herbivores) and to specific ecosystem compartments contributing to nutrient flows (primary producers, herbivores, or detritus). Ecosystems in distinct localities thus interact together with the structure at one place influencing that of the other. In meta ecosystems, the source-sink dynamics of an organism is not only constrained by its dispersal from the so.urce to the sink, but also by the fertility and community composition in the neighborhood responsible for spatial flows of nutrients and energy. The meta-ecosystem perspective provides a powerful theoretical framework to address novel questions in spatial ecosystem ecology},

abstract = {To assess which dispersal strategies are favored by natural selection, the potential of invasion by mutant (or immigrant) strategies into populations of resident dispersal strategists can be investigated. Such evolutionary invasion analyses are best based on the population dynamics between mutant and resident individuals. If the initial growth rate of a rare mutant within a given resident population is positive, the mutant can invade and typically replace the former resident. Repeated substitutions of this kind can take populations to a dispersal strategy (or to a polymorphism thereof) that is 'unbeatable' or 'evolutionarily stable'5. The theory of adaptive dynamics123 allows us to predict the resulting evolutionary change in continuous adaptive traits such as dispersal rates. Also, contingent dispersal strategies can be investigated, such as probabilities of dispersing from or into subpopulations of given densities, or dispersal rates that are dependent on age. How a model metapopulation is invaded by a new dispersal strategy is shown by the sequence of illustrations below. Each graph depicts the frequency distribution of patches inhabited by n resident and m mutant individuals. Within-patch dynamics are individual-based and logistic, and the rate of dispersal between patches is adaptive. Initially mutant strategists are few and far between, but they eventually take over the entire population. Using knowledge of population dynamics to predict success or failure of such invasions gives a theory for the evolution of dispersal that is firmly rooted in descriptions of ecological change.},

Acknowledging their variability and evolution has allowed us to understand how species adapt in response to their environment. The same traits are also involved in how species alter ecosystems and shape their dynamics and functioning. Some theories, such as the metabolic theory of ecology, ecological stoichiometry or pace-of-life theory, already recognize this junction, but only do so in an implicitly non-spatial context. Meanwhile, for a decade now, it has been argued that ecosystem properties have to be understood at a larger scale using meta-ecosystem theory because source-sink dynamics, community assembly and ecosystem stability are all modified by spatial structure. Here, we argue that some ecosystem properties can be linked to a single life-history trait, dispersal, i.e. the tendency of organisms to live, compete and reproduce away from their birth place. By articulating recent theoretical and empirical studies linking ecosystem functioning and dynamics to species dispersal, we aim to highlight both the known connections between life-history traits and ecosystem properties and the unknown areas, which deserve further empirical and theoretical developments.},

abstract = {Human-mediated dispersal is known as an important driver of long-distance dispersal for plants but underlying mechanisms have rarely been assessed. Road corridors function as routes of secondary dispersal for many plant species but the extent to which vehicles support this process remains unclear. In this paper we quantify dispersal distances and seed deposition of plant species moved over the ground by the slipstream of passing cars. We exposed marked seeds of four species on a section of road and drove a car along the road at a speed of 48 km/h. By tracking seeds we quantified movement parallel as well as lateral to the road, resulting dispersal kernels, and the effect of repeated vehicle passes. Median distances travelled by seeds along the road were about eight meters for species with wind dispersal morphologies and one meter for species without such adaptations. Airflow created by the car lifted seeds and resulted in longitudinal dispersal. Single seeds reached our maximum measuring distance of 45 m and for some species exceeded distances under primary dispersal. Mathematical models were fit to dispersal kernels. The incremental effect of passing vehicles on longitudinal dispersal decreased with increasing number of passes as seeds accumulated at road verges. We conclude that dispersal by vehicle airflow facilitates seed movement along roads and accumulation of seeds in roadside habitats. Dispersal by vehicle airflow can aid the spread of plant species and thus has wide implications for roadside ecology, invasion biology and nature conservation.},

abstract = {Herbarium accession data offer a useful historical botanical perspective and have been used to track the spread of plant invasions through time and space. Nevertheless, few studies have utilised this resource for genetic analysis to reconstruct a more complete picture of historical invasion dynamics, including the occurrence of separate introduction events. In this study, we combined nuclear and chloroplast microsatellite analyses of contemporary and historical collections of Senecio madagascariensis, a globally invasive weed first introduced to Australia c. 1918 from its native South Africa. Analysis of nuclear microsatellites, together with temporal spread data and simulations of herbarium voucher sampling, revealed distinct introductions to south-eastern Australia and mid-eastern Australia. Genetic diversity of the south-eastern invasive population was lower than in the native range, but higher than in the mid-eastern invasion. In the invasive range, despite its low resolution, our chloroplast microsatellite data revealed the occurrence of new haplotypes over time, probably as the result of subsequent introduction(s) to Australia from the native range during the latter half of the 20thcentury. Our work demonstrates how molecular studies of contemporary and historical field collections can be combined to reconstruct a more complete picture of the invasion history of introduced taxa. Further, our study indicates that a survey of contemporary samples only (as undertaken for the majority of invasive species studies) would be insufficient to identify potential source populations and occurrence of multiple introductions.},

Must our models include processes from all of these fields? We argue that answering this critical question is ultimately an empirical exercise requiring a substantial amount of data that have not been integrated for any system to date. To motivate and facilitate the necessary data collection and integration, we first review the potential importance of each mechanism for skilful prediction. We then develop a conceptual framework based on reaction norms, and propose a hierarchical Bayesian statistical framework to integrate processes affecting reaction norms at different scales.

In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully.

Here, we used forest inventory data to characterize variation in adult tree abundance along climate gradients for the 24 most common tree species in the northeastern United States. The two components of our measure of species abundance—local frequency vs. relative abundance—showed dramatically different patterns of variation along gradients of mean annual temperature and precipitation. Local frequency (i.e., the percentage of plots in a given climate in which a species occurred) varied strongly for all 24 species, particularly as a function of temperature. Relative abundance when present in a plot, on the other hand, was effectively constant for most species right up to their estimated climatic range limits. Although the range limits for both temperature and precipitation were quite broad for all of the species, the range of climates within which a species was common (i.e., high frequency) was much narrower. Because frequency in sites within a given climate shows a strong sensitivity to temperature, at least, this suggests that the processes determining canopy tree recruitment on new sites also vary strongly with climate.},

abstract = {In most tropical and subtropical biomes, conservation strategies are mainly focused on the preservation of forests. However, neotropical dry forest and savanna ecoregions include open habitats that may deserve conservation attention. We analyzed the historical patterns and potential distribution of natural grasslands, as well as their biodiversity in the northern Argentina dry Chaco, which is one of the largest and yet most rapidly transforming neotropical ecoregions. Paleocological literature, historical records, and bioclimatic modeling support the hypothesis that Chaco grasslands distribution was more extended in the past, and has been historically reduced by woody encroachment resulting from environmental changes occurred in the past century. Recent research shows that natural grasslands host distinctive components of the Chaco biodiversity, and a significant proportion of the vertebrate species have a negative association with woody biomass. Ongoing land use trends continue to threaten native grasslands both in unprotected sectors (where they are converted into agriculture and planted pastures) and inside protected areas (were fire suppression is favoring woody encroachment). Current conservation policies (Protected Areas, Argentine forest law, REDD+) neglect the importance of native grasslands for biodiversity conservation. Such forest-centered initiatives should be revised to specifically include native grasslands and their biodiversity into land use strategies that adequately balance agriculture and livestock production with biodiversity conservation.},

abstract = {The logging of large trees in tropical forests causes a decrease in the density of reproductive individuals, which likely affects the pattern of pollen dispersal and the mating system of the remaining trees in the population. Here, we investigate the impact of logging on mating system and genetic diversity of the low-density, thrip-pollinated, dioecious tree Bagassa guianensis within a 500-ha plot at Tapaj{\'{o}}s National Forest, Par{\'{a}} State, Brazil. Mating system parameters of the logged population were estimated using mixed-mating model. Six microsatellite loci were used to genotype 232 seeds from ten remnant female trees over three seasons (2006, 2007, and 2008). The data were compared with the mating system of the unlogged population of B. guianensis (18 female trees, 488 seeds) in the same plot. The overall number of alleles found in the open-pollinated progenies decreased after logging (K = 71 before logging and K = 57 after logging, considering the three after logging seasons pooled), as well as the average number of alleles per locus (A = 11.8 and 9.5, respectively). Similarly, the number of private alleles, which is defined in the context of this study as the number of alleles observed in the population exclusively before or after logging, also decreased after logging (15 and 1, respectively). However, the average number of alleles per locus and the observed and expected heterozygosities were not significantly higher before logging than after logging. Logging also did not affect the inbreeding of progenies in the population. Somewhat unexpectedly, the effective number of pollen donors was consistently higher after (N{\textless}inf{\textgreater}ep{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} = 14.5 in 2006, 8.1 in 2007, and 6.3 in 2008) than before logging (N{\textless}inf{\textgreater}ep{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} = 3.4), suggesting that the loss of alleles in the population was compensated by the higher heterogeneity in the pollen pool after the removal of the largest trees by logging. Potential causes explaining the patterns found here include the maintenance of large patches of forest around the logged plot and the species' ability to perform long-distance pollination by airborne thrips. Maintenance of landscape integrity as logged and unlogged forests around the exploited areas is recommended to enhance pollen migration and to avoid long-term losses in genetic diversity.},

Most conceptual forest development models do not incorporate current knowledge of the: (1) complexity of structures (including spatial patterns) and developmental processes; (2) duration of development in long-lived forests; (3) complex spatial patterns of stands that develop in later stages of seres; and particularly (4) the role of disturbances in creating structural legacies that become key elements of the post-disturbance stands. We elaborate on existing models for stand structural development using natural stand development of the Douglas-fir - western hemlock sere in the Pacific Northwest as our primary example; most of the principles are broadly applicable while some processes (e.g. role of epicormic branches) are related to specific species. We discuss the use of principles from disturbance ecology and natural stand development to create silvicultural approaches that are more aligned with natural processes. Such approaches provide for a greater abundance of standing dead and down wood and large old trees, perhaps reducing short-term commercial productivity but ultimately enhancing wildlife habitat, biodiversity, and ecosystem function, including soil protection and nutrient retention. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Inbreeding, SGS and realized patterns of pollen and seed dispersal of the dioecious, wind pollinated Araucaria angustifolia were investigated based on microsatellite loci. The study was conducted in a 7.2 ha plot established within a continuous Araucaria Forest in Southern Brazil. In the plot, all 290 adult trees were mapped, measured (diameter at breast height, dbh), sexed, sampled and genotyped. We also sampled, measured (total height), mapped and genotyped 223 juveniles. A total of 86 alleles were detected in the sample (n = 513). Adults and juveniles showed a positive and significant fixation index (minimum of 0.096), suggesting inbreeding or Wahlund effect. Juveniles presented a significant aggregated distribution which was associated with a genetic aggregation (significant SGS up to 20 m), indicating that near neighbor trees may be related due the limited seed dispersal. However, the intensity of SGS was not significantly higher among juveniles (Sp = 0.0041) than adults (Sp = 0.0026). Realized pollen and seed immigration into the plot was low (pollen = 6 {\%}; seeds = 5 {\%}) and the patterns of pollen and seed dispersal were similar. Pollen was dispersed over long distances (343 m), but 50 {\%} was dispersed up to 124 m. Seeds also reached long distances (318 m), with 50 {\%} being dispersed up to 133 m.

The effect was much stronger when considering the effect of body size within trophic position levels. Compared to extinctions ordered by body size, random extinction sequences had lower multiple species loss effects on functioning. Our study is the first to show experimentally, in multitrophic systems, a more negative impact of ordered extinction sequences on ecosystem functioning than random losses.

abstract = {Within species, population density tends to be greatest in the center of the range and to decline gradually toward the boundaries. This pattern holds over a range of spatial scales from steep environmental gradients within local regions to the entire geographic range. Exceptions include: 1) abrupt changes in abundance that usually correspond to sharp, discontinuous changes in single environmental variables; and 2) multimodal patterns of abundance caused by environmental patchiness. Among closely related, ecologically similar species spatial distribution is positively correlated with average abundance. A single general theory accounts for these observations and follows logically from 3 assumptions. 1) The abundance and distribution of each species are limited by the combination of physical and biotic environmental variables that determines the multidimensional niche. 2) Spatial variation in these environmental variables is somewhat stochastic but autocorrelated, so that nearby sites tend to have more similar environmental conditions than more distant ones. 3) Closely related, ecologically similar species differ in nor more than a very few niche dimensions. A more formal model can be developed that predicts that under these assumptions the distribution of population density over space should approximate a normal probability density distribution.-from Author},

However, recent progress towards a theoretical synthesis now provides a guiding framework for organizing and integrating all primary data and methods for spatiotemporal assemblage-level inference in ecology. In this paper, we describe how recent theoretical developments can provide an organizing paradigm for linking advances in data collection and methodological frameworks across disparate ecological sub-disciplines and across large spatial and temporal scales. First, we summarize the set of fundamental processes that determine change in multispecies assemblages across spatial and temporal scales by reviewing recent theoretical syntheses of community ecology. Second, we review recent advances in data and methods across the main sub-disciplines concerned with ecological inference across large spatial, temporal and taxonomic scales, and organize them based on the primary fundamental processes they include, rather than the spatiotemporal scale of their inferences. Finally, we highlight how iteratively focusing on only one fundamental process at a time, but combining all relevant spatiotemporal data and methods, may reduce the conceptual challenges to integration among ecological sub-disciplines. Moreover, we discuss a number of avenues for decreasing the practical barriers to integration among data and methods. We aim to reconcile the recent convergence of decades of thinking in community ecology and macroecology theory with the rapid progress in spatiotemporal approaches for assemblage-level inference, at a time where a robust understanding of spatiotemporal change in ecological assemblages is more crucial than ever to conserve biodiversity.},

abstract = {A scientific field matures as its theoretical underpinnings consolidate around unified theories: conceptual structures consisting of a few general propositions that encompass a wide domain of phenomena and from which can be derived an array of models. We demonstrate this process with a synthetic theory of ecological gradients and species richness. Our unified theory rests on four propositions. First, variation in some environmental factor effects variation in the number of individuals creating a gradient. Second, in a uniform environment of fixed area, more individuals lead to more species. Third, the variance of an environmental factor increases with its mean for sites of equal area. Fourth, all nonmonotonic relationships (i.e., hump shaped or U shaped) require a trade-off in organismal performance or in population characteristics with respect to the environmental gradient. We identify 17 models that link environmental gradients with diversity, show their relationship to our framework, and describe issues surrounding their empirical testing. We illustrate how a general theory can be used to build new models such as that for the U-shaped productivity-diversity relationship. Finally, we discuss how our theory could be unified further with other theories of diversity and indicate other areas of ecology that are ripe for unification. By providing an example of the process of theory unification, we hope to encourage such efforts throughout ecology.},

abstract = {1. The dispersal capabilities of most plant species remain unknown. However, gaining basic dispersal information is a critical step for understanding species' geographical distributions and for predicting the likely impacts of future climate change. Dispersal mechanisms can indicate short- or long-distance dispersers, and highlight important biological interactions. 2. To predict dispersal mechanisms for species where information is limited, we used generalized linear mixed models with basic life-history and ecological traits. Sets of models were created (using Australian species) for six dispersal categories: wind, unassisted, water, ant, vertebrate-ingestion and vertebrate-attachment dispersal mechanisms. We validated our models on the dispersal mechanisms of 50 Australian, 30 Californian, 30 Swiss plant species and a global compilation of 70 species. 3. Growth form, seed mass and vegetation type were the main predictor variables. Our models predicted dispersal mechanisms for Australian and Californian plant species equally well (c. 70{\%} correct) and to a lesser extent for the Swiss flora (c. 50{\%}correct). Our models predicted observed dispersal mechanisms (c. 50{\%}correct) equally well to inferred dispersal mechanisms (based on seed morphology). 4. Synthesis. Our approach of using easily obtainable traits for predicting dispersal mechanisms of species allows dispersal information to be predicted for species where little is known. Fromhere, the application of realistic dispersal curves to the predicted dispersal mechanisms will further under- standing on the dispersal capabilities of species.},

An alternative approach to curb species extinction risk involves improving connectivity among existing habitat patches. However, evaluation of spatially explicit management strategies is challenging, as predictive models must account for the process of dispersal, which is difficult both in terms of empirical data collection and modelling. 2.Here we use a novel, individual-based modelling platform that couples demographic and mechanistic dispersal models to evaluate the effectiveness of realistic management scenarios tailored to conserve forest birds in a highly fragmented biodiversity hotspot. Scenario performance is evaluated based on the spatial population dynamics of a well-studied forest bird species. 3.The largest population increase was predicted to occur under scenarios increasing habitat area. However, the effectiveness was sensitive to spatial planning. Compared to adding one large patch to the habitat network, adding several small patches yielded mixed benefits: although overall population sizes increased, specific newly created patches acted as dispersal sinks, which compromised population persistence in some existing patches. Increasing matrix connectivity by the creation of stepping stones is likely to result in enhanced dispersal success and occupancy of smaller patches. 4.Synthesis and applications. We show that the effectiveness of spatial management is strongly driven by patterns of individual dispersal across landscapes. For species conservation planning, we advocate the use of models that incorporate adequate realism in demography and, particularly, in dispersal behaviours.},

abstract = {Abstract Populations of many species are genetically adapted to local historical climate conditions. Yet most forecasts of species? distributions under climate change have ignored local adaptation (LA), which may paint a false picture of how species will respond across their geographical ranges. We review recent studies that have incorporated intraspecific variation, a potential proxy for LA, into distribution forecasts, assess their strengths and weaknesses, and make recommendations for how to improve forecasts in the face of LA. The three methods used so far (species distribution models, response functions, and mechanistic models) reflect a trade-off between data availability and the ability to rigorously demonstrate LA to climate. We identify key considerations for incorporating LA into distribution forecasts that are currently missing from many published studies, including testing the spatial scale and pattern of LA, the confounding effects of LA to non-climatic or biotic drivers, and the need to incorporate empirically-based dispersal or gene flow processes. We suggest approaches to better evaluate these aspects of LA and their effects on species-level forecasts. In particular, we highlight demographic and dynamic evolutionary models as promising approaches to better integrate LA into forecasts, and emphasize the importance of independent model validation. Finally, we urge closer examination of how LA will alter the responses of central vs. marginal populations to allow stronger generalizations about changes in distribution and abundance in the face of LA.

abstract = {Aim: Tree species may be vulnerable to migration lags because they are sessile, long-lived, have a small intrinsic growth rate and relatively short dispersal. Our study assesses if those ecological mechanisms will mitigate the progression of the north-eastern American temperate forest leading edge into the boreal forest. Location: The North-eastern boreal-temperate forest ecotone (from 43° to 51° North and 80° to 60° West). Taxon: Our approach involved 15 forest species classified into four representative forest communities of the eastern boreal-temperate forest. Methods: We performed simulations on the boreal-temperate ecotone using a state and transition model (STM), wherein forest communities are classified in four states: boreal, temperate, mixed and stands in regeneration. We propose a new modelling approach based on metapopulation theory to account for dispersal limitations and the demography of the temperate and boreal forests. We calibrated the STM model with an extensive dataset of 48,940 forest inventory plots. We projected the boreal-temperate forest landscape over 23 General Circulation models (GCMs) from the RCP 8.5 emission scenario to study the forest communities dynamics at the landscape scale under climate change. Results: Simulations of climate changes predict a significant increase of temperate forest dominance within the ecotone, mainly due to the conversion of mixed stands into temperate stands. The leading edge of the temperate forest will however move only 304 m in latitude (95{\%} CI: 0.18–0.56) into the boreal forest by the end of this century. In comparison, the average expansion rate was 2,555 m/year (95{\%} CI: 1,969–2,932) when we released the dispersal constraint and even higher with an average rate of 7,197 m/year (95{\%} CI: 5,722–9,776) when we released the dispersal and demography constraints. Main conclusions: The northern edge of the temperate forest distribution does not change with almost no movement toward the north for either temperate or mixed communities by the end of this century. Slow demographic and dispersal rates prevent any substantial movement in temperate forests, with much faster migration rates when these constraints are removed.},

abstract = {Forecasts of rapid climate change raise the question how quickly species can evolutionarily adapt to future climates. The adaptability of forest trees to environmental changes is generally promoted by high levels of genetic diversity and gene flow, but it can also be slowed down by long generation times and low mortality of established trees. Here, we investigate the adaptation of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and Silver birch (Betula pendula) to climate change induced prolongation of the thermal growing season. We use quantitative genetic individual-based simulations to disentangle the relative roles of mortality, dispersal ability and maturation age for the speed of adaptation. The simulations predict that after 100 years of climate change, the genotypic growth period length of both species will lag more than 50{\%} behind the climatically determined optimum. This lag is reduced by increased mortality of established trees, whereas earlier maturation and higher dispersal ability had comparatively minor effects. The evolutionary lag behind environmental change shown in our simulations stresses the importance of accounting for evolutionary processes in forecasts of the future dynamics and productivity of forests. Sensitivity of the adaptation speed to mortality suggests that species experiencing high mortality rates as well as populations subject to regular disturbances such as storms or fires might be the quickest to adapt to a warming climate. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Field sampling errors, such as missing in-trees, did not affect our tests. Virtual variable-and fixed-radius plots were randomly located within an artificial matrix of 130 real plots in well-stocked upland hardwood forests of sawtimber-sized trees in the Missouri Ozarks. Inventory parameters were essentially independent of plot size and BAF, whereas their coefficients of variation decreased with plot size and increased with BAF. Thus, our results for random plots agreed with sampling theory, unlike a previous study using concentric virtual plots in West Virginia forests. A very concentrated zone of high tree density around some plot centers apparently caused the biased estimates by concentric plots. Compared with the entire composite forest, inventory means were accurately estimated (to within 5{\%}) and size class distributions were well represented for plots ≥0.1 ac or ≤ 15 BAF. Our procedures provide a basis for selecting an efficient and cost-effective sampling design suited to forest characteristics and the inventory's purpose.

abstract = {AimThe geographic distributions of different forest types are expected to shift in the future under altered climatic conditions. At present, the nature, magnitude and timing of these shifts are uncertain because we lack a quantitative understanding of how forest distributions emerge from climate- and competition-related variation in underlying demographic processes. Forest dynamics result primarily from the manner in which the physical environment and competition for limiting resources affect tree growth, mortality and recruitment. We sought to uncover the relative importance of these processes in controlling the geographic limits of different forest types. LocationEastern USA. MethodsWe parameterized a climate-dependent forest dynamics model with extensive observations of tree growth, mortality and recruitment from forest inventory data. We then implemented the resulting demographic models in simulations of joint population dynamics for seven plant functional types (PFTs) across the region. By removing various climate effects in a series of simulation experiments, we assessed the importance of climate-dependent demography and competition in limiting forest distributions. ResultsDistributions that emerged from simulated population dynamics approximated the current distributions for all seven PFTs well and captured several known patterns of succession. Temperature-related increases in mortality determined the southern boundaries of three out of four boreal and northern temperate PFTs, whereas temperature-related decreases in recruitment controlled the northern limit of all three southern temperate PFTs. Changes in growth rates and competitor performance had only minor effects on the distribution limits of most PFTs. Main conclusionsOur results imply that dynamic global vegetation models, which are widely used to predict future vegetation distributions under climate change, should seek to more appropriately capture the observed climate sensitivity of mortality and recruitment. Understanding the mechanisms controlling forest distributions will enable better predictions of their future responses to climate change.},

abstract = {To assess the impacts of climate change on vegetation from stand to global scales, models of forest dynamics that include tree demography are needed. Such models are now available for 50 years, but the currently existing diversity of model formulations and its evolution over time are poorly documented. This hampers systematic assessments of structural uncertainties in model-based studies. We conducted a meta-analysis of 28 models, focusing on models that were used in the past five years for climate change studies. We defined 52 model attributes in five groups (basic assumptions, growth, regeneration, mortality and soil moisture) and characterized each model according to these attributes. Analyses of model complexity and diversity included hierarchical cluster analysis and redundancy analysis. Model complexity evolved considerably over the past 50 years. Increases in complexity were largest for growth processes, while complexity of modelled establishment processes increased only moderately. Model diversity was lowest at the global scale, and highest at the landscape scale. We identified five distinct clusters of models, ranging from very simple models to models where specific attribute groups are rendered in a complex manner and models that feature high complexity across all attributes. Most models in use today are not balanced in the level of complexity with which they represent different processes. This is the result of different model purposes, but also reflects legacies in model code, modelers' preferences, and the ‘prevailing spirit of the epoch'. The lack of firm theories, laws and ‘first principles' in ecology provides high degrees of freedom in model development, but also results in high responsibilities for model developers and the need for rigorous model evaluation. Synthesis. The currently available model diversity is beneficial: convergence in simulations of structurally different models indicates robust projections, while convergence of similar models may convey a false sense of certainty. The existing model diversity—with the exception of global models—can be exploited for improved projections based on multiple models. We strongly recommend balanced further developments of forest models that should particularly focus on establishment and mortality processes, in order to provide robust information for decisions in ecosystem management and policymaking.},

We analysed a combination of allelic and flanking region sequence data from microsatellite markers, and evaluated the relative influence of environmental preferences and functional traits on genetic diversity and gene flow. The results indicate that only in three species geographic structuring of haplotype distribution reflects a north vs. south of the BMC pattern. Environmental factors linked with altitude were recognized as affecting genetic trends, but the selective processes operating on upland species appear to be associated with competitiveness and regeneration opportunities on poor soil types rather than climate variables alone. In contrast to previous observations within southeastern Australian rainforests, genetic differentiation in the AWT appears to be associated with small-fruited rather than large-fruited species, highlighting how external factors can influence the dispersal dimension. Overall, this study emphasizes the importance of considering functional and environmental factors when attempting generalizations on landscape-level patterns of genetic variation. Understanding how plant functional groups respond to environmental and climatic heterogeneity can help us predict responses to future change. {\textcopyright} 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

Next, we review two broad categories of methods, focused on the spatial domain, for modeling potential range shifts and future suitable habitat: empirical species-distribution models and more process-based simulations. We propose long-term demography studies as a complementary approach in the time domain when sufficient data are available. Dispersal and successful migration into newly suitable habitat are key mechanisms constraining range shifts.

abstract = {Understanding how species respond to climate change is critical for forecasting the future dynamics and distribution of pests, diseases and biological diversity. Although ecologists have long acknowledged species' direct physiological and demographic responses to climate, more recent work suggests that these direct responses can be overwhelmed by indirect effects mediated via other interacting community members. Theory suggests that some of the most dramatic impacts of community change will probably arise through the assembly of novel species combinations after asynchronous migrations with climate. Empirical tests of this prediction are rare, as existing work focuses on the effects of changing interactions between competitors that co-occur today. To explore how species' responses to climate warming depend on how their competitors migrate to track climate, we transplanted alpine plant species and intact plant communities along a climate gradient in the Swiss Alps. Here we show that when alpine plants were transplanted to warmer climates to simulate a migration failure, their performance was strongly reduced by novel competitors that could migrate upwards from lower elevation; these effects generally exceeded the impact of warming on competition with current competitors. In contrast, when we grew the focal plants under their current climate to simulate climate tracking, a shift in the competitive environment to novel high-elevation competitors had little to no effect. This asymmetry in the importance of changing competitor identity at the leading versus trailing range edges is best explained by the degree of functional similarity between current and novel competitors. We conclude that accounting for novel competitive interactions may be essential to predict species' responses to climate change accurately.},

Using tree-ring signatures of cold damage from common garden trials designed to study genetic population differentiation, we find opposing geographic clines for spring frost and fall frost damage. Provenances from northern regions are sensitive to spring frosts, while the more productive provenances from central and southern regions are more susceptible to fall frosts. Transferring the southern, warm-adapted genotypes northward causes a significant loss of growth and a permanent rank change after a spring frost event.

abstract = {The belief that canopy gaps are important for the maintenance of tree species diversity appears to be widespread, but there have been no formal theoretical models to assess under what conditions gap phase processes allow coexistence. Much of the empirical research on niche differentiation in response to gaps has focused on evidence for an interspecific tradeoff between low light survival and high light growth. The objectives of this study are first to distinguish the possible mechanisms allowing coexistence based on this tradeoff, and second, to explore their limitations. We present a theory of forest dynamics driven by small-scale disturbances as a special case of the theory of coexistence in variable environments. We demonstrate that temporal and spatial heterogeneity in light conditions that results from canopy gaps can allow stable coexistence as a result of three previously documented general mechanisms: ‘relative non-linearity', ‘the successional niche' and the ‘storage effect'. We find that temporal fluctuations in light availability alone allow the stable coexistence of only two species. Spatial variation in disturbance synchronicity and intensity allows three species to coexist in a narrow parameter space. The rate of extinction is, however, extremely slow and there is transient coexistence of a larger number of species for a long period of time. We conclude that while the low light survival/high light growth tradeoff may be ubiquitous in forest tree species, it is unlikely to function as an important mechanism for the stable coexistence of several tree species.},

abstract = {Range dynamics causes mismatches between a species' geographical distribution and the set of suitable environments in which population growth is positive (the Hutchinsonian niche). This is because source-sink population dynamics cause species to occupy unsuitable environments, and because environmental change creates non-equilibrium situations in which species may be absent from suitable environments (due to migration limitation) or present in unsuitable environments that were previously suitable (due to time-delayed extinction). Because correlative species distribution models do not account for these processes, they are likely to produce biased niche estimates and biased forecasts of future range dynamics. Recently developed dynamic range models (DRMs) overcome this problem: they statistically estimate both range dynamics and the underlying environmental response of demographic rates from species distribution data. This process-based statistical approach qualitatively advances biogeographical analyses. Yet, the application of DRMs to a broad range of species and study systems requires substantial research efforts in statistical modelling, empirical data collection and ecological theory. Here we review current and potential contributions of these fields to a demographic understanding of niches and range dynamics. Our review serves to formulate a demographic research agenda that entails: (1) advances in incorporating process-based models of demographic responses and range dynamics into a statistical framework, (2) systematic collection of data on temporal changes in distribution and abundance and on the response of demographic rates to environmental variation, and (3) improved theoretical understanding of the scaling of demographic rates and the dynamics of spatially coupled populations. This demographic research agenda is challenging but necessary for improved comprehension and quantification of niches and range dynamics. It also forms the basis for understanding how niches and range dynamics are shaped by evolutionary dynamics and biotic interactions. Ultimately, the demographic research agenda should lead to deeper integration of biogeography with empirical and theoretical ecology. {\textcopyright} 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

Increases were also pervasive across elevations, tree sizes, dominant genera, and past fire histories. Forest density and basal area declined slightly, which suggests that increasing mortality was not caused by endogenous increases in competition. Because mortality increased in small trees, the overall increase in mortality rates cannot be attributed solely to aging of large trees.

However, recent progress towards a theoretical synthesis now provides a guiding framework for organizing and integrating all primary data and methods for spatiotemporal assemblage-level inference in ecology. In this paper, we describe how recent theoretical developments can provide an organizing paradigm for linking advances in data collection and methodological frameworks across disparate ecological sub-disciplines and across large spatial and temporal scales. First, we summarize the set of fundamental processes that determine change in multispecies assemblages across spatial and temporal scales by reviewing recent theoretical syntheses of community ecology. Second, we review recent advances in data and methods across the main sub-disciplines concerned with ecological inference across large spatial, temporal and taxonomic scales, and organize them based on the primary fundamental processes they include, rather than the spatiotemporal scale of their inferences. Finally, we highlight how iteratively focusing on only one fundamental process at a time, but combining all relevant spatiotemporal data and methods, may reduce the conceptual challenges to integration among ecological sub-disciplines. Moreover, we discuss a number of avenues for decreasing the practical barriers to integration among data and methods. We aim to reconcile the recent convergence of decades of thinking in community ecology and macroecology theory with the rapid progress in spatiotemporal approaches for assemblage-level inference, at a time where a robust understanding of spatiotemporal change in ecological assemblages is more crucial than ever to conserve biodiversity.},

We identify three indicators of a regime shift occurring in our experimental poor fen system under climate change: nonlinear decline of Sphagnum at temperatures 8 °C above ambient conditions, concomitant increases in Carex spp. at temperatures 4 °C above ambient conditions suggesting a weakening of Sphagnum feedbacks on peat accumulation, and increased variance of the plant community composition and pore water pH through time. A temperature increase of +4 °C appeared to be a threshold for increased vascular plant abundance; however the magnitude of change was species dependent. Elevated temperature combined with elevated CO2 had a synergistic effect on large graminoid species abundance, with a 15 times increase as compared to control conditions. Community analyses suggested that the balance between dominant plant species was tipped from Sphagnum to a graminoid-dominated system by the combination of climate change factors. Our findings indicate that changes in peatland plant community composition are likely under future climate change conditions, with a demonstrated shift toward a dominance of graminoid species in poor fens.},

abstract = {In a context of global changes, and amidst the perpetual modification of community structure undergone by most natural ecosystems, it is more important than ever to understand how species interactions vary through space and time. The integration of biogeography and network theory will yield important results and further our understanding of species interactions. It has, however, been hampered so far by the difficulty to quantify variation among interaction networks. Here, we propose a general framework to study the dissimilarity of species interaction networks over time, space or environments, allowing both the use of quantitative and qualitative data. We decompose network dissimilarity into interactions and species turnover components, so that it is immediately comparable to common measures of {\$}\beta{\$}-diversity. We emphasise that scaling up {\$}\beta{\$}-diversity of community composition to the {\$}\beta{\$}-diversity of interactions requires only a small methodological step, which we foresee will help empiricists adopt this method. We illustrate the framework with a large dataset of hosts and parasites interactions and highlight other possible usages. We discuss a research agenda towards a biogeographical theory of species interactions.},

abstract = {In the coming century, forecast climate changes caused by increasing greenhouse gases may produce dramatic shifts in tree species distributions and the rates at which individual tree species sequester carbon or release carbon back to the atmosphere. The species composition and carbon storage capacity of northern Wisconsin (USA) forests are expected to change significantly as a result. Projected temperature changes are relatively large (up to a 5.8 °C increase in mean annual temperature) and these forests encompass a broad ecotone that may be particularly sensitive to climate change. Our objective was to estimate the combined effects of climate change, common disturbances, and species migrations on regional forests using spatially interactive simulations. Multiple scenarios were simulated for 200 years to estimate aboveground live biomass and tree species composition. We used a spatially interactive forest landscape model (LANDIS-II) that includes individual tree species, biomass accumulation and decomposition, windthrow, harvesting, and seed dispersal. We used data from two global circulation models, the Hadley Climate Centre (version 2) and the Canadian Climate Center (version 1) to generate transient growth and decomposition parameters for 23 species. The two climate change scenarios were compared with a control scenario of continuing current climate conditions. The results demonstrate how important spatially interactive processes will affect the aboveground live biomass and species composition of northern Wisconsin forests. Forest composition, including species richness, is strongly affected by harvesting, windthrow, and climate change, although five northern species (Abies balsamea, Betula papyrifera, Picea glauca, Pinus banksiana, P. resinosa) are lost in both climate scenarios regardless of disturbance scenario. Changes in aboveground live biomass over time are nonlinear and vary among ecoregions. Aboveground live biomass will be significantly reduced because of species dispersal and migration limitations. The expected shift towards southern oaks and hickory is delayed because of seed dispersal limitations. {\textcopyright} 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Cryptic species represent a conservation challenge, because distributions and threats cannot be accurately assessed until species are recognized and defined. Cryptic species are common in diminutive and morphologically simple organisms, but are rare in charismatic and/or highly visible groups such as conifers. New Caledonia, a small island in the southern Pacific is a hotspot of diversity for the emblematic conifer genus Araucaria (Araucariaceae, Monkey Puzzle trees) where 13 of the 19 recognized species are endemic. METHODS: We sampled across the entire geographical distribution of two closely related species (Araucaria rulei and A. muelleri) and screened them for genetic variation at 12 nuclear and 14 plastid microsatellites and one plastid minisatellite; a subset of the samples was also examined using leaf morphometrics. KEY RESULTS: The genetic data show that populations of the endangered A. muelleri fall into two clearly distinct genetic groups: one corresponding to montane populations, the other corresponding to trees from lower elevation populations from around the Goro plateau. These Goro plateau populations are more closely related to A. rulei, but are sufficiently genetically and morphological distinct to warrant recognition as a new species. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows the presence of a previously unrecognized species in this flagship group, and that A. muelleri has 30{\%} fewer individuals than previously thought. Combined, this clarification of species diversity and distributions provides important information to aid conservation planning for New Caledonian Araucaria.},

abstract = {Preserving large tracts of natural habitats is essential to maintain biodiversity. Nevertheless, even large areas may still suffer from less "visible" impacts such as loss of ecological processes. Because mapping ecological processes over large scales is not practical, an alternative is to map surrogate species that are key for those processes. In this study, we chose four species of Neotropical large mammals (the largest apex predator: jaguar - Panthera onca; the largest herbivore: tapir - Tapirus terrestris; the largest seed predator: white-lipped peccary - Tayassu pecari; and the largest arboreal seed disperser: muriqui - Brachyteles spp.) in an ecosystem with an old history of human impact (the Atlantic Forest) to test whether areas with native forest still harbor ecological processes that may guarantee long-term ecosystem maintenance. We gathered 94 locations with recent presence of the four species to map current ranges and model suitable areas. Our results reveal that 96{\%} of the remaining Atlantic Forest is depleted of at least one of the four surrogate species and 88{\%} is completely depleted of all four surrogate species. We also found that only 16{\%} is still environmentally suitable for all four, and 55{\%} is completely unsuitable to all four of them. Our study highlights the importance of looking beyond land cover to fully depict intactness of natural areas, and suggests that ecosystems with a long history of human impact (such as the Atlantic Forest) may be suffering from ecological impacts not seen at a first glance. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Here, we matched the growth of 270,000 trees across a 761,100 km2 region with detailed site-level data to quantify the growth responses of the seven most common boreal tree species in Eastern Canada to changes in climate. Accounting for spatially-explicit species-specific responses, we find that while 2 °C of warming may increase overall forest productivity by 13 ± 3{\%} (mean ± SE) in the absence of disturbance, additional warming could reverse this trend and lead to substantial declines exacerbated by reductions in water availability. Our results confirm the transitory nature of warming-induced growth benefits in the boreal forest and highlight the vulnerability of the ecosystem to excess warming and drying.},

abstract = {Community assembly rules have been extensively studied, but its association with regional environmental variation, while land use history remains largely unexplored. Land use history might be especially important in Mediterranean forests, considering their historical deforestation and recent afforestation. Using forest inventories and historical (1956) and recent (2000) land cover maps, we explored the following hypotheses: 1) woody species assembly is driven by environmental factors, but also by historical landscape attributes; 2) recent forests exhibit lower woody species richness than pre-existing due to the existence of colonization credits; 3) these credits are modulated by species' life-forms and dispersal mechanisms. We examined the association of forest historical type (pre-existing versus recent) with total species richness and that of diverse life-forms and dispersal groups, also considering the effects of current environment and past landscape factors. When accounting for these effects, no significant differences in woody species richness were found between forest historical types except for vertebrate-dispersed species. Species richness of this group was affected by the interaction of forest historical type with distance to coast and rainfall: vertebrate-dispersed species richness increased with rainfall and distance to the coast in recent forests, while it was higher in dryer sites in pre-existing forests. In addition, forest historical types showed differences in woody species composition associated to diverse environmental and past landscape factors. In view of these results we can conclude that: 1) community assembly in terms of species richness is fast enough to exhaust most colonization credit in recent Mediterranean forests except for vertebrate-dispersed species; 2) for these species, colonization credit is affected by the interplay of forest history and a set of proxies of niche and landscape constraints of species dispersal and establishment; 3) woody species assemblage is mostly shaped by the species' ecological niches in these forests.},

abstract = {Aim: The geographic distributions of different forest types are expected to shift in the future under altered climatic conditions. At present, the nature, magnitude and timing of these shifts are uncertain because we lack a quantitative understanding of how forest distributions emerge from climate- and competition-related variation in underlying demographic processes. Forest dynamics result primarily from the manner in which the physical environment and competition for limiting resources affect tree growth, mortality and recruitment. We sought to uncover the relative importance of these processes in controlling the geographic limits of different forest types. Location: Eastern USA. Methods: We parameterized a climate-dependent forest dynamics model with extensive observations of tree growth, mortality and recruitment from forest inventory data. We then implemented the resulting demographic models in simulations of joint population dynamics for seven plant functional types (PFTs) across the region. By removing various climate effects in a series of simulation experiments, we assessed the importance of climate-dependent demography and competition in limiting forest distributions. Results: Distributions that emerged from simulated population dynamics approximated the current distributions for all seven PFTs well and captured several known patterns of succession. Temperature-related increases in mortality determined the southern boundaries of three out of four boreal and northern temperate PFTs, whereas temperature-related decreases in recruitment controlled the northern limit of all three southern temperate PFTs. Changes in growth rates and competitor performance had only minor effects on the distribution limits of most PFTs. Main conclusions: Our results imply that dynamic global vegetation models, which are widely used to predict future vegetation distributions under climate change, should seek to more appropriately capture the observed climate sensitivity of mortality and recruitment. Understanding the mechanisms controlling forest distributions will enable better predictions of their future responses to climate change. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.

abstract = {Fire suppression and limited forest management have caused overstocking in many forests across the western United States. Overstocked stands have higher competition for limiting resources and causes tree stress. The amount of stress a tree experiences is related to the current availability of resources (site productivity), and the competition for those resources (stand density). Stressed trees are more susceptible to insects, disease, and mortality, which cause fuel buildup and increase wildfire risk. Pre-commercial thinning (PCT) can alleviate stress by decreasing the amount of competition in younger stands. The objective of this study was to determine how reducing competition through PCT might improve resource availability to trees at a range of initial stand conditions.We used a triplet-plot approach including 4.3 m and 5.5 m spacing and compared those to unthinned controls in stands varying in site productivity (height growth) and density (initial stand basal area) throughout northern Idaho and northeastern Washington. Stands were dominated by Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco), grand fir (Abies grandis (Douglas ex D. Don) Lindley), and western red cedar (Thuja plicata Donn ex D. Don). As expected, higher density stands intercepted greater amounts of light. Thinned stands intercepted 33-58{\%} less light than controls, depending on tree spacing. Site productivity was positively correlated with soil moisture in the spring and soil temperature in both the spring and summer. Pre-commercial thinning increased soil moisture by 6{\%} in the spring and 10{\%} in the summer, and soil temperature increased by 0.5 °C in spring and 1 °C in summer. Douglas-fir foliar N, Ca, Zn concentration decreased after thinning, while P and B increased and S, K, and Cu were unchanged. Thinning had the greatest relative impact on summer soil moisture, followed by soil N availability, and light interception. Thinning response studies frequently focus on light availability; our results demonstrate that the response of soil moisture and nutrient availability exceeded that of light availability for the studied forest types.},

Interest in plant dispersal has increased with concerns about the persistence of populations and species under global change. We argue here that advances in plant dispersal ecology research will be determined by our ability to surmount challenges of spatiotemporal scales and heterogeneities and ecosystem complexity. Based on this framework, we propose a selected set of research questions, for which we suggest some specific objectives and methodological approaches. Reviewed topics include multiple vector contributions to plant dispersal, landscape-dependent dispersal patterns, long-distance dispersal events, spatiotemporal variation in dispersal, and the consequences of dispersal for plant communities, populations under climate change, and anthropogenic landscapes.},

@article{Holling1973,
abstract = {Each family of the desert isopod Hemilepistus reaumuri uses its faeces to build an embankment around its burrow entrance in the form of a ring with an inner radius of 5-10 cm and an outer radius of 8-15 cm. Although the embankment, like the burrow entrance, is detected only by contact with the antennae, it facilitates the return to the burrow after an excursion. When a desert isopod returns from foraging it reaches the burrow entrance itself (diameter 12 mm) only in ca. 12{\%} of the observed cases by "dead reckoning"; the embankment, however, is reached six times more frequently. After detecting this landmark an isopod needs a further 12{\%} of the pathlength of the preceding excursion to locate the burrow entrance. In contrast, it travels five times further to reach its burrow from the same distance (10 cm) if the landmark is missing. The landmark is even more important when the isopod, because of a large error in orientation, can reach its burrow only by searching. Both the characteristics of the search path of H. reaumuri and the success of it's search behaviour correspond well to the respective features of a theoretical procedure, which best solves the search problem of the desert isopods assuming that a landmark is available for orientation. The optimal search procedure was calculated by using information about the probability density that an error in orientation has a given size, and the cumulative probability that the landmark is detected if the isopod searches in it's region with a given intensity. The coupling of the systematic search strategy of H. reaumuri with landmark orientation shortens the average time needed for homing by one-third. It helps an isopod to return to it's burrow after foraging even if all the orientation mechanisms normally used for this task have broken down.},

abstract = {The importance of biodiversity in supporting ecosystem functioning is generally well accepted. However, most evidence comes from small-scale studies, and scaling-up patterns of biodiversity–ecosystem functioning (B-EF) remains challenging, in part because the importance of environmental factors in shaping B-EF relations is poorly understood. Using a forest research platform in which 26 ecosystem functions were measured along gradients of tree species richness in six regions across Europe, we investigated the extent and the potential drivers of context dependency of B-EF relations. Despite considerable variation in species richness effects across the continent, we found a tendency for stronger B-EF relations in drier climates as well as in areas with longer growing seasons and more functionally diverse tree species. The importance of water availability in driving context dependency suggests that as water limitation increases under climate change, biodiversity may become even more important to support high levels of functioning in European forests.},

abstract = {Populations near the warm edge of species ranges may be particularly sensitive to climate change, but lack of empirical data on responses to warming represents a key gap in understanding future range dynamics. Herein we document the impacts of experimental warming on the performance of 11 boreal and temperate forest species that co-occur at the ecotone between these biomes in North America. We measured in situ net photosynthetic carbon gain and growth of {\textgreater}4,100 juvenile trees from local seed sources exposed to a chamberless warming experiment that used infrared heat lamps and soil heating cables to elevate temperatures by +3.4 °C above- and belowground for three growing seasons across 48 plots at two sites. In these ecologically realistic field settings, species growing nearest their warm range limit exhibited reductions in net photosynthesis and growth, whereas species near their cold range limit responded positively to warming. Differences among species in their three-year growth responses to warming parallel their photosynthetic responses to warming, suggesting that leaf-level responses may scale to whole-plant performance. These responses are consistent with the hypothesis, from observational data and models, that warming will reduce the competitive ability of currently dominant southern boreal species compared with locally rarer co-occurring species that dominate warmer neighbouring regions.},

abstract = {Detecting latitudinal range shifts of forest trees in response to recent climate change is difficult because of slow demographic rates and limited dispersal but may be facilitated by spatially compressed climatic zones along elevation gradients in montane environments. We resurveyed forest plots established in 1964 along elevation transects in the Green Mountains (Vermont) to examine whether a shift had occurred in the location of the northern hardwood-boreal forest ecotone (NBE) from 1964 to 2004. We found a 19{\%} increase in dominance of northern hardwoods from 70{\%} in 1964 to 89{\%} in 2004 in the lower half of the NBE. This shift was driven by a decrease (up to 76{\%}) in boreal and increase (up to 16{\%}) in northern hardwood basal area within the lower portions of the ecotone. We used aerial photographs and satellite imagery to estimate a 91- to 119-m upslope shift in the upper limits of the NBE from 1962 to 2005. The upward shift is consistent with regional climatic change during the same period; interpolating climate data to the NBE showed a 1.1 degrees C increase in annual temperature, which would predict a 208-m upslope movement of the ecotone, along with a 34{\%} increase in precipitation. The rapid upward movement of the NBE indicates little inertia to climatically induced range shifts in montane forests; the upslope shift may have been accelerated by high turnover in canopy trees that provided opportunities for ingrowth of lower elevation species. Our results indicate that high-elevation forests may be jeopardized by climate change sooner than anticipated.},

abstract = {1. Abscission of seeds in some plant species occurs as a result of strong wind gusts that exert sufficient drag forces to liberate the seed from its parent. This may be an adaptive feature, as release into stronger wind gusts has been shown to lead to greater dispersal distances, which is likely to have evolutionary advantages. 2. We test the hypotheses that (i) seeds released into upward wind gusts will, on average, travel further than those seeds released into wind gusts with horizontal or downward orientations and (ii) that the preferential abscission of seeds into upward wind gusts will result in the dispersal of seeds over greater distances. 3. As a case study, we studied the abscission dynamics of Conyza bonariensis (L.) Cronquist (fleabane), which is an important weed with global distribution. Using abscission data obtained through a series of seed release experiments, we confirm that abscission of seeds in C. bonariensis is most likely to occur during strong and upward wind gusts. 4. We demonstrate that, for a given wind speed, seeds released into upward wind gusts will, on average, travel further than those seeds released into wind gusts with horizontal or downward orientations. We also show that preferential release into upward wind gusts has some influence on the distance travelled, but the strength of this influence is dependent on the correlation between wind orientation and wind speed. For this particular study, the sensitivity of release to the horizontal wind speed seems to have a larger effect on the distance travelled than sensitivity to wind orientation.},

abstract = {Dynamic vegetation models (DVMs) are important tools to understand and predict the functioning and dynamics of terrestrial ecosystems under changing environmental conditions. In these models, uncertainty in the description of demographic processes, in particular tree mortality, is a persistent problem. Current mortality formulations lack realism and are insufficiently constrained by empirical evidence. It has been suggested that empirically estimated mortality submodels would enhance DVM performance, but due to the many processes and interactions within a DVM, the claim has rarely been tested. Here, we compare the performance of three alternative growth-dependent tree mortality submodels in the DVM ForClim: (1) a mortality function with theoretical foundation (ForClim v3.3); (2) a mortality function with parameters directly estimated based on forest inventory data; and (3) the same function, but with parameters estimated using an inverse approach through Bayesian calibration (BC). Time series of inventory data from 30 ecologically distinct Swiss natural forest reserves collected over 35+ yr, including the main tree species of Central Europe, were used for the calibration and subsequent validation of the mortality functions and the DVM. The recalibration resulted in mortality parameters that differed from the direct empirical estimates, particularly for the relationship between tree size and mortality. The calibrated parameters outperformed the direct estimates, and to a lesser extent the original mortality function, for predicting decadal-scale forest dynamics at both calibration and validation sites. The same pattern was observed regarding the plausibility of their long-term projections under contrasting environmental conditions. Our results demonstrate that inverse calibration may be useful even when direct empirical estimates of DVM parameters are available, as structural model deficiencies or data problems can result in discrepancies between direct and inverse estimates. Thus, we interpret the good performance of the inversely calibrated model for long-term projections (which were not a calibration target) as evidence that the calibration did not compensate for model errors. Rather, we surmise that the discrepancy was mainly caused by a lack of representativeness of the mortality data. Our results underline the potential for learning more about elusive processes, such as tree mortality or recruitment, through data integration in DVMs.},

A total-exclusion battery comprising four chloroplast and two nuclear microsatellites (theoretical paternity exclusion probability EP = 0.996) was used to assign paternity to 813 seeds, collected from 34 trees in the stand. Long-distance pollen immigration accounted for 4.3{\%} of observed matings. Self-fertilization rate was very high (0.25), compared with typical values in more widespread populations of the species. The average effective pollen dispersal distance within the stand was 48 m (or 83 m excluding selfs). Half of effective pollen was dispersed within 11 m, and 7{\%} beyond 200 m. A strong correlation was found between the distance to the closest tree and the mean mating-distance calculated for single-tree progenies. The effective pollen dispersal distribution showed a leptokurtic shape, with a large and significant departure from that expected under uniform dispersal. A maximum-likelihood procedure was used to fit an individual pollen dispersal distance probability density function (dispersal kernel). The estimated kernel indicated fairly leptokurtic dispersal (shape parameter b = 0.67), with an average pollen dispersal distance of 135 m, and 50{\%} of pollen dispersed beyond 30 m. A marked directionality pattern of pollen dispersal was found, mainly caused by the uneven distribution of trees, coupled with restricted dispersal and unequal male success. Overall, results show that the number and distribution of potential pollen donors in small populations may strongly influence the patterns of effective pollen dispersal.},

abstract = {Habitat suitability estimated with probability of occurrence in species distribution models (SDMs) is used in conservation to identify geographic areas that are most likely to harbor individuals of interest. In theory, probability of occurrence is coupled with individual fitness so that individuals have higher fitness at the centre of their species environmental niche than at the edges, which we here define as 'fitness-centre' hypothesis. However, such relationship is uncertain and has been rarely tested across multiple species. Here, we quantified the relationship between coarse-scale probability of occurrence projected with SDMs and individual fitness in 66 tree species native of North America. We used 1) field data of individuals' growth rate (height and diameter standardized by age) available from the United States Forest Inventory Analysis plots; and 2) common garden data collected from 23 studies reporting individual growth rate, survival, height and diameter of individuals originated from different provenances in United States and Canada. We show 'fitness-centre' relationships are rare, with only 12{\%} and 11{\%} of cases showing a significant positive correlation for field and common garden data, respectively. Furthermore, we found the 'fitness-centre' relationship is not affected by the precision of the SDMs and it does not depend upon dispersal ability and climatic breath of the species. Thus, although the 'fitness-centre' relationship is supported by theory, it does not hold true in nearly any species. Because individual fitness plays a relevant role in buffering local extinction and range contraction following climatic changes and biotic invasions, our results encourage conservationists not to assume the 'fitness-centre' relationship when modelling species distribution.},

abstract = {The biosphere is under unprecedented pressure, reflected in rapid changes in our global ecological, social, technological and economic systems. In many cases, ecological and social systems can adapt to these changes over time, but when a critical threshold is surpassed, a system under stress can undergo catastrophic change and reorganize into a different state. The concept of resilience, introduced more than 40 years ago in the ecological sciences, captures the beha- viour of systems that can occur in alternative states. The original definition of resilience forwarded by Holling (1973) is still the most useful. It defines resilience as the amount of disturbance that a system can withstand before it shifts into an alternative stable state. The idea of alternative stable states has clear and profound implications for ecological management. Coral reefs, for example, are high-diversity systems that provide key ecosystem services such as fisheries and coastal protection. Human impacts are causing signifi- cant, ongoing reef degradation, and many reefs have shifted from coral- to algal-dominated states in response to anthro- pogenic pressures such as elevated water temperatures and overfishing. Understanding and differentiating between the factors that help maintain reefs in coral-dominated states vs. those that facilitate a shift to an undesired algal-domi- nated state is a critical step towards sound management and conservation of these, and other, important social–ecologi- cal systems.},

abstract = {Greenhouse gas emissions have significantly altered global climate, and will continue to do so in the future. Increases in the frequency, duration, and/or severity of drought and heat stress associated with climate change could fundamentally alter the composition, structure, and biogeography of forests in many regions. Of particular concern are potential increases in tree mortality associated with climate-induced physiological stress and interactions with other climate-mediated processes such as insect outbreaks and wildfire. Despite this risk, existing projections of tree mortality are based on models that lack functionally realistic mortality mechanisms, and there has been no attempt to track observations of climate-driven tree mortality globally. Here we present the first global assessment of recent tree mortality attributed to drought and heat stress. Although episodic mortality occurs in the absence of climate change, studies compiled here suggest that at least some of the world's forested ecosystems already may be responding to climate change and raise concern that forests may become increasingly vulnerable to higher background tree mortality rates and die-off in response to future warming and drought, even in environments that are not normally considered water-limited. This further suggests risks to ecosystem services, including the loss of sequestered forest carbon and associated atmospheric feedbacks. Our review also identifies key information gaps and scientific uncertainties that currently hinder our ability to predict tree mortality in response to climate change and emphasizes the need for a globally coordinated observation system. Overall, our review reveals the potential for amplified tree mortality due to drought and heat in forests worldwide.},

abstract = {To explain diversity in forests, niche theory must show how multiple plant species coexist while competing for the same resources. Although successional processes are widespread in forests, theoretical work has suggested that differentiation in successional strategy allows only a few species stably to coexist, including only a single shade tolerant. However, this conclusion is based on current niche models, which encode a very simplified view of plant communities, suggesting that the potential for niche differentiation has remained unexplored. Here, we show how extending successional niche models to include features common to all vegetation - height-structured competition for light under a prevailing disturbance regime and two trait-mediated tradeoffs in plant function - enhances the diversity of species that can be maintained, including a diversity of shade tolerants. We identify two distinct axes of potential niche differentiation, corresponding to the traits leaf mass per unit leaf area and height at maturation. The first axis allows for coexistence of different shade tolerances and the second axis for coexistence among species with the same shade tolerance. Addition of this second axis leads to communities with a high diversity of shade tolerants. Niche differentiation along the second axis also generates regions of trait space wherein fitness is almost equalized, an outcome we term "evolutionarily emergent near-neutrality." For different environmental conditions, our model predicts diverse vegetation types and trait mixtures, akin to observations. These results indicate that the outcomes of successional niche differentiation are richer than previously thought and potentially account for mixtures of traits and species observed in forests worldwide.},

abstract = {Patterns of pollen dispersal were investigated in a small, isolated, relict population of Pinus sylvestris L., consisting of 36 trees. A total-exclusion battery comprising four chloroplast and two nuclear microsatellites (theoretical paternity exclusion probability EP=0.996) was used to assign paternity to 813 seeds, collected from 34 trees in the stand. Long-distance pollen immigration accounted for 4.3{\%} of observed matings. Self-fertilization rate was very high (0.25), compared with typical values in more widespread populations of the species. The average effective pollen dispersal distance within the stand was 48 m (or 83 m excluding selfs). Half of effective pollen was dispersed within 11 m, and 7{\%} beyond 200 m. A strong correlation was found between the distance to the closest tree and the mean mating-distance calculated for single-tree progenies. The effective pollen dispersal distribution showed a leptokurtic shape, with a large and significant departure from that expected under uniform dispersal. A maximum-likelihood procedure was used to fit an individual pollen dispersal distance probability density function (dispersal kernel). The estimated kernel indicated fairly leptokurtic dispersal (shape parameter b=0.67), with an average pollen dispersal distance of 135 m, and 50{\%} of pollen dispersed beyond 30 m. A marked directionality pattern of pollen dispersal was found, mainly caused by the uneven distribution of trees, coupled with restricted dispersal and unequal male success. Overall, results show that the number and distribution of potential pollen donors in small populations may strongly influence the patterns of effective pollen dispersal.},

abstract = {Long - term forest productivity decline in boreal forests has been extensively studied in the last decades , yet its causes are still unclear . Soil conditions associated with soil organic matter accumulation are thought to be responsible for site productivity decline . The objectives of this study were to determine if paludification of boreal soils resulted in reduced forest productivity , and to identify changes in the physical and chemical properties of soils associated with reduction in productivity . We used a chronosequence of 23 black spruce stands ranging in postfire age from 50 to 2350 years and calculated three different stand productivity indices , including site index . We assessed changes in forest productivity with time using two complementary approaches : (1) by comparing productivity among the chronosequence stands and (2) by comparing the productivity of successive cohorts of trees within the same stands to determine the influence of time independently of other site factors . Charcoal stratigraphy indicates that the forest stands differ in their fire history and originated either from high - or low - severity soil burns . Both chronosequence and cohort approaches demonstrate declines in black spruce productivity of 50 – 80{\%} with increased paludification , particularly during the first centuries after fire . Paludification alters bryophyte abundance and succession , increases soil moisture , reduces soil temperature and nutrient availability , and alters the vertical distribution of roots . Low - severity soil burns significantly accelerate rates of paludification and productivity decline compared with high - severity fires and ultimately reduce nutrient content in black spruce needles . The two combined approaches indicate that paludification can be driven by forest succession only , independently of site factors such as position on slope . This successional paludification contrasts with edaphic paludification , where topography and drainage primarily control the extent and rate of paludification . At the landscape scale , the fire regime (frequency and severity) controls paludification and forest productivity through its effect on soil organic layers . Implications for global carbon budgets and sustainable forestry are discussed .},

abstract = {Range dynamics causes mismatches between a species' geographical distribution and the set of suitable environments in which population growth is positive (the Hutchinsonian niche). This is because source–sink population dynamics cause species to occupy unsuitable environments, and because environmental change creates non-equilibrium situations in which species may be absent from suitable environments (due to migration limitation) or present in unsuitable environments that were previously suitable (due to time-delayed extinction). Because correlative species distribution models do not account for these processes, they are likely to produce biased niche estimates and biased forecasts of future range dynamics. Recently developed dynamic range models (DRMs) overcome this problem: they statistically estimate both range dynamics and the underlying environmental response of demographic rates from species distribution data. This process-based statistical approach qualitatively advances biogeographical analyses. Yet, the application of DRMs to a broad range of species and study systems requires substantial research efforts in statistical modelling, empirical data collection and ecological theory. Here we review current and potential contributions of these fields to a demographic understanding of niches and range dynamics. Our review serves to formulate a demographic research agenda that entails: (1) advances in incorporating process-based models of demographic responses and range dynamics into a statistical framework, (2) systematic collection of data on temporal changes in distribution and abundance and on the response of demographic rates to environmental variation, and (3) improved theoretical understanding of the scaling of demographic rates and the dynamics of spatially coupled populations. This demographic research agenda is challenging but necessary for improved comprehension and quantification of niches and range dynamics. It also forms the basis for understanding how niches and range dynamics are shaped by evolutionary dynamics and biotic interactions. Ultimately, the demographic research agenda should lead to deeper integration of biogeography with empirical and theoretical ecology.},

abstract = {Extensive realized pollen and seed flow across populations reduces inbreeding and spatial genetic structure (SGS) and increases the genetic diversity and effective size within populations. Inbreeding, SGS and realized patterns of pollen and seed dispersal of the dioecious, wind pollinated Araucaria angustifolia were investigated based on microsatellite loci. The study was conducted in a 7.2 ha plot established within a continuous Araucaria Forest in Southern Brazil. In the plot, all 290 adult trees were mapped, measured (diameter at breast height, dbh), sexed, sampled and genotyped. We also sampled, measured (total height), mapped and genotyped 223 juveniles. A total of 86 alleles were detected in the sample (n = 513). Adults and juveniles showed a positive and significant fixation index (minimum of 0.096), suggesting inbreeding or Wahlund effect. Juveniles presented a significant aggregated distribution which was associated with a genetic aggregation (significant SGS up to 20 m), indicating that near neighbor trees may be related due the limited seed dispersal. However, the intensity of SGS was not significantly higher among juveniles (Sp = 0.0041) than adults (Sp = 0.0026). Realized pollen and seed immigration into the plot was low (pollen = 6 {\%}; seeds = 5 {\%}) and the patterns of pollen and seed dispersal were similar. Pollen was dispersed over long distances (343 m), but 50 {\%} was dispersed up to 124 m. Seeds also reached long distances (318 m), with 50 {\%} being dispersed up to 133 m. Our results are discussed in terms of auto-ecology and the genetic conservation of A. angustifolia populations. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract = {Most large-scale multispecies studies of tree growth have been conducted in tropical and cool temperate forests, whereas Mediterranean water-limited ecosystems have received much less attention. This limits our understanding of how growth of coexisting tree species varies along environmental gradients in these forests, and the implications for species interactions and community assembly under current and future climatic conditions. Here, we quantify the absolute effect and relative importance of climate, tree size and competition as determinants of tree growth patterns in Iberian forests, and explore interspecific differences in the two components of competitive ability (competitive response and effect) along climatic and size gradients. Spatially explicit neighborhood models were developed to predict tree growth for the 15 most abundant Iberian tree species using permanent-plot data from the Spanish Second and Third National Forest Inventory (IFN). Our neighborhood analyses showed a climatic and size effect on tree growth, but also revealed that competition from neighbors has a comparatively much larger impact on growth in Iberian forests. Moreover, the sensitivity to competition (i.e. competitive response) of target trees varied markedly along climatic gradients causing significant rank reversals in species performance, particularly under xeric conditions. We also found compelling evidence for strong species-specific competitive effects in these forests. Altogether, these results constitute critical new information which not only furthers our understanding of important theoretical questions about the assembly of Mediterranean forests, but will also be of help in developing new guidelines for adapting forests in this climatic boundary to global change. If we consider the climatic gradients of this study as a surrogate for future climatic conditions, then we should expect absolute growth rates to decrease and sensitivity to competition to increase in most forests of the Iberian Peninsula (in all but the northern Atlantic forests), making these management considerations even more important in the future. {\textcopyright} 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

While maternal gamete groups showed a significant FST value across the 5 years, this was not true for their paternal counterparts. Within the population, we found that the relative reproductive contributions of the paternal vs. the maternal parent differed among adult trees, the maternal contributions showing a larger year-to-year fluctuation. •$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The overall genetic variability of dispersed seeds appeared to result from two sources of heterogeneity: the difference between paternal and maternal patterns of reproduction and gamete dispersal and year-to-year heterogeneity of reproduction of adult trees, especially in their maternal reproduction.},

We used a mul- ti-regional dataset of 1485 sites across 52 wildfires from the US Rocky Mountains to ask if and how changing climate over the last several decades impacted post-fire tree regeneration, a key indicator of forest resilience. Results highlight significant decreases in tree regeneration in the 21st century. Annual moisture deficits were significantly greater from 2000 to 2015 as compared to 1985–1999, suggesting increasingly unfavourable post-fire growing conditions, corresponding to significantly lower seedling densities and increased regeneration failure. Dry forests that already occur at the edge of their climatic tolerance are most prone to conversion to non-forests after wildfires. Major climate-induced reduction in forest density and extent has important conse- quences for a myriad of ecosystem services now and in the future.},

abstract = {This study reviews the diet of 26 granivorous bird species of European temperate farmland, and evidence for the effects of agricultural practices on their invertebrate and plant foods, in order to assess whether the latter could have contributed to recent widespread population declines of farmland birds. Cereal grain and seeds of Polygonum (knotgrasses and persicarias), Stellaria (chickweeds) and Chenopodium (goosefoots) are important for the bird species considered. Seeds and green material of Asteraceae, Fabaceae, and Brassicaceae are also widely used, the seeds of Asteraceae particularly by cardueline finches. Declining bird species are not associated with particular plant foods, but reductions in overall diversity and abundance of food plants have taken place in intensively managed arable land. Grassland intensification has reduced floral diversity, and the quantity and diversity of grass and broad-leaved seed produced, but some plant species of value to granivorous birds benefit from high-nitrogen environments and may increase in availability (e.g., Stellaria – chickweeds). During the breeding season, Acrididae (grasshoppers), Symphyta (sawflies), Araneae (spiders), Chrysomelidae (leaf-beetles), Curculionidae (weevils), Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths and their larvae), Aphididae (aphids) and Tipulidae (crane-flies and their larvae) are important foods. The first four are associated with the diet of declining bird species, and all are sensitive to insecticide applications. Herbicide applications, increasing specialisation of farmland, loss of uncultivated field margin habitats, and ploughing are also associated with generally detrimental effects on invertebrate groups in arable habitats. In intensively managed grassland, loss of grasshoppers, ants, spiders and lepidopteran larvae removes an important source of food for younger chicks of a wide range of species. Some phytophagous taxa and predators, however, may be more abundant due to the greater standing biomass of plant material. Overall, intensification and specialisation of arable and grassland systems is likely to have reduced the availability of key invertebrate and seed foods for birds. However, there is also evidence that reversal of intensification, especially in arable systems can result in rapid recovery of these resources. In intensively managed farmland, uncultivated field margins, hedgerows, ditches and road verges are likely to become increasingly important sources of seed and invertebrate food for birds.},

abstract = {The study of species co-occurrences has been central in community ecology since the foundation of the discipline. Co-occurrence data are, nevertheless, a neglected source of information to model species distributions and biogeographers are still debating about the impact of biotic interactions on species distributions across geographical scales. We argue that a theory of species co-occurrence in ecological networks is needed to better inform interpretation of co-occurrence data, to formulate hypotheses for different community assembly mechanisms, and to extend the analysis of species distributions currently focused on the relationship between occurrences and abiotic factors. The main objective of this paper is to provide the first building blocks of a general theory for species co-occurrences. We formalize the problem with definitions of the different probabilities that are studied in the context of co-occurrence analyses. We analyze three species interactions modules and conduct multi-species simulations in order to document five principles influencing the associations between species within an ecological network: (i) direct interactions impact pairwise co-occurrence, (ii) indirect interactions impact pairwise co-occurrence, (iii) pairwise co-occurrence rarely are symmetric, (iv) the strength of an association decreases with the length of the shortest path between two species, and (v) the strength of an association decreases with the number of interactions a species is experiencing. Our analyses reveal the difficulty of the interpretation of species interactions from co-occurrence data. We discuss whether the inference of the structure of interaction networks is feasible from co-occurrence data. We also argue that species distributions models could benefit from incorporating conditional probabilities of interactions within the models as an attempt to take into account the contribution of biotic interactions to shaping individual distributions of species.},

abstract = {Seed dispersal is important both to plant fitness and to plant population structure. We suggest that the tail of the seed dispersal curve is at least as important biologically as the modal portion of the curve, and we present a relatively simple, four-parameter model, based on diffusion principles, for the tail of the seed distribution. This model includes two types of qualitative behavior: algebraic tails (which tend to be longer and have greater 'reach') and exponential tails (which are shorter and have less 'reach'). We have selected 68 data sets from the literature, each giving a seed shadow that could be categorized statistically as (1) exponential, (2) algebraic, (3) neither, or (4) both models fit adequately. Algebraic shapes for seed-shadow tails were common in this sample, and tail behavior was not generally specific to a particular dispersal mode. This result may suggest that algebraic tails are generally favored by selection and can be achieved by several means, but limitations of existing data sets and of statistical methodology preclude final judgement.

abstract = {Forest fragmentation dramatically alters species persistence and distribution and affects many ecological interactions among species. Recent studies suggest that mutualisms, such as pollination and seed dispersal, are more sensitive to the negative effects of forest fragmentation than antagonisms, such as predation or herbivory. We applied meta-analytical techniques to evaluate this hypothesis and quantified the relative contributions of different components of the fragmentation process (decreases in fragment size, edge effects, increased isolation, and habitat degradation) to the overall effect. The effects of fragmentation on mutualisms were primarily driven by habitat degradation, edge effects, and fragment isolation, and, as predicted, they were consistently more negative on mutualisms than on antagonisms. For the most studied interaction type, seed dispersal, only certain components of fragmentation had significant (edge effects) or marginally significant (fragment size) effects. Seed size modulated the effect of fragmentation: species with large seeds showed stronger negative impacts of fragmentation via reduced dispersal rates. Our results reveal that different components of the habitat fragmentation process have varying impacts on key mutualisms. We also conclude that antagonistic interactions have been understudied in fragmented landscapes, most of the research has concentrated on particular types of mutualistic interactions such as seed dispersal, and that available studies of interspecific interactions have a strong geographical bias (arising mostly from studies carried out in Brazil, Chile, and the United States).

abstract = {Projected changes in temperature and drought regime are likely to reduce carbon (C) storage in forests, thereby amplifying rates of climate change. While such reductions are often presumed to be greatest in semi-arid forests that experience widespread tree mortality, the consequences of drought may also be important in temperate mesic forests of Eastern North America (ENA) if tree growth is significantly curtailed by drought. Investigations of the environmental conditions that determine drought sensitivity are critically needed to accurately predict ecosystem feedbacks to climate change. We matched site factors with the growth responses to drought of 10,753 trees across mesic forests of ENA, representing 24 species and 346 stands, to determine the broad-scale drivers of drought sensitivity for the dominant trees in ENA. Here we show that two factors—the timing of drought, and the atmospheric demand for water (i.e., local potential evapotranspiration; PET)—are stronger drivers of drought sensitivity than soil and stand characteristics. Drought-induced reductions in tree growth were greatest when the droughts occurred during early-season peaks in radial growth, especially for trees growing in the warmest, driest regions (i.e., highest PET). Further, mean species trait values (rooting depth and $\psi$50) were poor predictors of drought sensitivity, as intraspecific variation in sensitivity was equal to or greater than interspecific variation in 17 of 24 species. From a general circulation model ensemble, we find that future increases in early-season PET may exacerbate these effects, and potentially offset gains in C uptake and storage in ENA owing to other global change factors.},

abstract = {Dennis, B. 2002. Allee effects in stochastic populations. -Oikos 96: 389-401. The Allee effect, or inverse density dependence at low population sizes, could seriously impact preservation and management of biological populations. The mount-ing evidence for widespread Allee effects has lately inspired theoretical studies of how Allee effects alter population dynamics. However, the recent mathematical models of Allee effects have been missing another important force prevalent at low population sizes: stochasticity. In this paper, the combination of Allee effects and stochasticity is studied using diffusion processes, a type of general stochastic population model that accommodates both demographic and environmental stochastic fluctuations. Includ-ing an Allee effect in a conventional deterministic population model typically produces an unstable equilibrium at a low population size, a critical population level below which extinction is certain. In a stochastic version of such a model, the probability of reaching a lower size a before reaching an upper size b, when considered as a function of initial population size, has an inflection point at the underlying deterministic unstable equilibrium. The inflection point represents a threshold in the probabilistic prospects for the population and is independent of the type of stochastic fluctuations in the model. In particular, models containing demo-graphic noise alone (absent Allee effects) do not display this threshold behavior, even though demographic noise is considered an "extinction vortex". The results in this paper provide a new understanding of the interplay of stochastic and deterministic forces in ecological populations.},

Determining the likelihood of these events requires an understanding of population dynamics and dispersal. We address these issues in populations of a critically endangered tropical conifer Araucaria nemorosa and provide conservation recommendations. Location Port Boise, island of Grand Terre, New Caledonia, Pacific Ocean. Methods We characterize the demographic structure of six populations of A. nemorosa based upon size class frequencies and relative basal area compared to competing angiosperm trees. Using genotype data from 280 adult individuals at seven microsatellite loci, we indirectly estimate dispersal distances and project a maximal dispersal envelope around the extant populations. Results Our survey detected marked differences in demographic parameters including the proportion of basal area occupied by A. nemorosa versus angiosperm trees (ranging from 25{\%} to 77{\%}), the size class frequency distributions of A. nemorosa and seedling densities (ranging from 500 to 37300seedlingsha -1) among some populations. Wright's genetic neighbourhood ranged from 22 to 876 trees, and historic gene dispersal ranged from 10.8 to 82.4m, indicating that most seed dispersal is {\textless}100m. Main conclusions This study indicates that the risk of recruitment failure in remnant populations of Araucaria nemorosa is low in most of the stands but is high in the inland population For{\^{e}}t Nord. In situ natural regeneration appears to be constrained in this population, most likely as a consequence of competitive exclusion. Our results also suggest that the majority of seed dispersal is too short to allow A. nemorosa to disperse to new more hospitable sites within an ecologically relevant time-scale. Our findings have implications not only for this emblematic tree species but also for a wide range of fragmented and degraded plant species populations with limited dispersal that are vulnerable to competitive exclusion. {\textcopyright} 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Rising global temperatures are suggested to be drivers of shifts in tree species ranges. The resulting changes in community composition may negatively impact forest ecosystem function. However, long-term shifts in tree species ranges remain poorly documented. We test for shifts in the northern range limits of 16 temperate tree species in Quebec, Canada, using forest inventory data spanning three decades, 15° of longitude and 7° of latitude. Range shifts were correlated with climate warming and dispersal traits to understand potential mechanisms underlying changes. Shifts were calculated as the change in the 95th percentile of latitudinal occurrence between two inventory periods (1970–1978, 2000–2012) and for two life stages: saplings and adults. We also examined sapling and adult range offsets within each inventory, and changes in the offset through time. Tree species ranges shifted predominantly northward, although species responses varied. As expected shifts were greater for tree saplings, 0.34 km yr−1, than for adults, 0.13 km yr−1. Range limits were generally further north for adults compared to saplings, but the difference diminished through time, consistent with patterns observed for range shifts within each life stage. This suggests caution should be exercised when interpreting geographic range offsets between life stages as evidence of range shifts in the absence of temporal data. Species latitudinal velocities were on average {\textless}50{\%} of the velocity required to equal the spatial velocity of climate change and were mostly unrelated to dispersal traits. Finally, our results add to the body of evidence suggesting tree species are mostly limited in their capacity to track climate warming, supporting concerns that warming will negatively impact the functioning of forest ecosystems.

In ecotones, areas of ecological tension, disturbances may provide opportunities for some migrating species to establish in otherwise competitive environments. The size of and time since disturbance may determine the establishment ability of these species. We investigated gap dynamics of an old-growth red pine (Pinus resinosa Sol. ex Aiton) forest in the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence forest in northern Ontario, Canada, a transition zone between temperate and boreal forest. We investigated the effects of gaps of different sizes and ages on tree species abundance and basal area. Our results show that tree species from the temperate forest further south, such as red maple (Acer rubrum L.), red oak (Quercus rubra L.), and white pine (Pinus strobus L.), establish more often in large, old gaps; however, tree species that have more northern distributions, such as black spruce (Picea mariana Mill.), paper birch (Betula papyrifera Marsh.), and red pine show no difference in establishment ability with gap size or age. These differences in composition could not be attributed to autogenic succession. We conclude that treefall gaps in this forest facilitate the establishment of northward migrating species, potentially providing a pathway for future forest migration in response to recent changes in climate. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Checking that models adequately represent data is an essential component of applied statistical inference. Ecologists increasingly use hierarchical Bayesian statistical models in their research. The appeal of this modeling paradigm is undeniable, as researchers can build and fit models that embody complex ecological processes while simultaneously accounting for observation error. However, ecologists tend to be less focused on checking model assumptions and assessing potential lack of fit when applying Bayesian methods than when applying more traditional modes of inference such as maximum likelihood. There are also multiple ways of assessing the fit of Bayesian models, each of which has strengths and weaknesses. For instance, Bayesian P values are relatively easy to compute, but are well known to be conservative, producing P values biased toward 0.5. Alternatively, lesser known approaches to model checking, such as prior predictive checks, cross-validation probability integral transforms, and pivot discrepancy measures may produce more accurate characterizations of goodness-of-fit but are not as well known to ecologists. In addition, a suite of visual and targeted diagnostics can be used to examine violations of different model assumptions and lack of fit at different levels of the modeling hierarchy, and to check for residual temporal or spatial autocorrelation. In this review, we synthesize existing literature to guide ecologists through the many available options for Bayesian model checking. We illustrate methods and procedures with several ecological case studies including (1) analysis of simulated spatiotemporal count data, (2) N-mixture models for estimating abundance of sea otters from an aircraft, and (3) hidden Markov modeling to describe attendance patterns of California sea lion mothers on a rookery. We find that commonly used procedures based on posterior predictive P values detect extreme model inadequacy, but often do not detect more subtle cases of lack of fit. Tests based on cross-validation and pivot discrepancy measures (including the “sampled predictive P value”) appear to be better suited to model checking and to have better overall statistical performance. We conclude that model checking is necessary to ensure that scientific inference is well founded. As an essential component of scientific discovery, it should accompany most Bayesian analyses presented in the literature.},

abstract = {Ecosystems and ecosystem services are subjected to both typical disturbances (e.g., fire) and shifting climatic baselines resulting from anthropogenic drivers. Recovery from these perturbations is of prime interest to researchers and land managers. We explore how differing regeneration of the coniferous forest to specific disturbances and a shifting climate are mediated through managerial responses, in terms of both species composition and an important ecosystem service, carbon sequestration in the southern Rocky Mountains, Colorado, USA. 112 sites across a variety of disturbance histories were surveyed for post-fire regeneration; carbon stock growth was then simulated in the US Forest Service Forest Vegetation Simulator under a variety of climate change scenarios for 100. years. Simultaneously, we simulated three managerial responses to the disturbance: no action, planting of local species (resilience-oriented management), and planting of the most climatically suitable species (adaptation-oriented management). These managerial responses simulate varying levels of intervention which attempt to maintain forest properties and associated carbon stocks. Carbon stocks, initially, were more resilient than the coniferous forest system; areas with little coniferous regeneration recovered carbon at a similar pace due to an influx of deciduous seedlings. However, future climate exerts a strong influence on carbon stocks. Both the no-action scenario and the resilience-oriented management scenario transitioned to non-forest by the end of the simulation period, due to climatic changes. Active, adaptation-oriented management, which included establishment of non-local species, maintained forest structure and carbon stocks under most future climate projections, albeit at lower densities. So while this preserves the presence of a forest, it does not preserve the presence of a specific forest. However, for ecosystem services associated with the mere existence of forest cover (e.g., carbon stocks and general forest habitat), this may be sufficient. In a sense, disturbances are opportunities for more climatically-adapted species/communities to establish, although the complexities of assisted migration and novel ecosystems remain. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Weeds are both harmful for crop production and important for biodiversity, while herbicides can pollute the environment. We thus need new cropping systems optimising all cultural techniques, reconciling agricultural production, herbicide reduction and biodiversity conservation. Here, we show how to (i) develop models quantifying the effects of cropping systems on weed dynamics, (ii) integrate interactions between weeds and other organisms, (iii) predict the impact on production and biodiversity and (iv) use the model for multicriteria evaluation and multiobjective design of cropping systems. Among the existing weed dynamics models, we chose the one closest to our requirements to illustrate these different steps, that is, FlorSys which predicts multispecific weed dynamics as a function of cultural techniques and pedoclimate. We have illustrated the development of interaction submodels with the example of a crop pathogen whose propagation is increased when infecting grass weeds. To evaluate the weed flora impact, predicted weed densities were translated into indicators of harmfulness (crop yield loss, technical harvest problems, harvest pollution, field infestation, crop disease increase) and biodiversity (weed species richness and equitability, trophic resources for birds, insects and pollinators). Simulations were run over several years and with different weather scenarios (i) to optimise cultural techniques to control harmful weeds, (ii) to analyse the impact of changing agricultural practices (e.g. simplified tillage and rotations, no-till, temporary crops) on weed density, species and trait composition and (iii) to evaluate cropping systems for their ability to reconcile agricultural production and biodiversity, thus identifying levers for designing sustainable cropping systems.},

abstract = {Classical approaches to food webs focus on patterns and processes occurring at the community level rather than at the broader ecosystem scale, and often ignore spatial aspects of the dynamics. However, recent research suggests that spatial processes influence both food web and ecosystem dynamics, and has led to the idea of 'metaecosystems'. However, these processes have been tackled separately by 'food web metacommunity' ecology, which focuses on the movement of traits, and 'landscape ecosystem' ecology, which focuses on the movement of materials among ecosystems. Here, we argue that this conceptual gap must be bridged to fully understand ecosystem dynamics because many natural cases demonstrate the existence of interactions between the movements of traits and materials. This unification of concepts can be achieved under the metaecosystem framework, and we present two models that highlight how this framework yields novel insights. We then discuss patches, limiting factors and spatial explicitness as key issues to advance metaecosystem theory. We point out future avenues for research on metaecosystem theory and their potential for application to biological conservation.},

abstract = {Ecological communities around the world are under threat while a consensus theory of community structure remains elusive. In the last decade ecologists have struggled with two seemingly opposing theories: niche-based theory that explains diversity with species' differences and the neutral theory of biodiversity that claims that much of the diversity we observe can be explained without explicitly invoking species' differences. Although ecologists are increasingly attempting to reconcile these two theories, there is still much resistance against the neutral theory of biodiversity. Here we argue that the dispute between the two theories is a classic example of the dichotomy between philosophical perspectives, realism and instrumentalism. Realism is associated with specific, small-scale and detailed explanations, whereas instrumentalism is linked to general, large-scale, but less precise accounts. Recognizing this will help ecologists get both niche-based and neutral theories in perspective as useful tools for understanding biodiversity patterns.},

abstract = {Despite their narrow distribution, Australian rainforests still contain considerable levels of diversity and include many ancient, but often rare, lineages. Very little is known about the general biology of rainforest species, yet their long-term management depends on a better understanding of the main factors leading to rarity. For instance, are they highly endemic taxa, at the early stages of expansion, nearing the end of a period of decline, or persisting at low numbers over the long term? In this study we combine molecular, environmental, and ecological data to identify the factors responsible for the narrow distribution of a paleoendemic rainforest tree: Elaeocarpus sedentarius (Elaeocarpaceae). Between-population and between-generation comparisons of genetic diversity across all known populations of E. sedentarius show evidence of mutation-drift equilibrium rather than evidence of a recent bottleneck. Similarly, floristic and environmental data negate the hypothesis of rarity as a consequence of highly specialized habitat requirements. Instead, genetic structure and the available ecological data support the hypothesis of dispersal limitation as the main cause of endemism and that the species may have attained genetic equilibrium without realizing its full niche potential. We suggest that these factors are likely to explain narrow endemism in a broader range of taxa.},

abstract = {A growing understanding of the ecology of seed dispersal has so far had little influence on conservation practice, while the needs of conservation practice have had little influence on seed dispersal research. Yet seed dispersal interacts decisively with the major drivers of biodiversity change in the 21st century: habitat fragmentation, overharvesting, biological invasions, and climate change. We synthesize current knowledge of the effects these drivers have on seed dispersal to identify research gaps and to show how this information can be used to improve conservation management. The drivers, either individually, or in combination, have changed the quantity, species composition, and spatial pattern of dispersed seeds in the majority of ecosystems worldwide, with inevitable consequences for species survival in a rapidly changing world. The natural history of seed dispersal is now well-understood in a range of landscapes worldwide. Only a few generalizations that have emerged are directly applicable to conservation management, however, because they are frequently confounded by site-specific and species-specific variation. Potentially synergistic interactions between disturbances are likely to exacerbate the negative impacts, but these are rarely investigated. We recommend that the conservation status of functionally unique dispersers be revised and that the conservation target for key seed dispersers should be a population size that maintains their ecological function, rather than merely the minimum viable population. Based on our analysis of conservation needs, seed dispersal research should be carried out at larger spatial scales in heterogenous landscapes, examining the simultaneous impacts of multiple drivers on community-wide seed dispersal networks. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The ability of plants to disperse seeds may be critical for their survival under the current constraints of landscape fragmentation and climate change. Seed dispersal distance would therefore be an important variable to include in species distribution models. Unfortunately, data on dispersal distances are scarce, and seed dispersal models only exist for some species with particular dispersal modes. To overcome this lack of knowledge, we propose a simple approach to estimate seed dispersal. distances for a whole regional flora. We reviewed literature about seed dispersal in temperate regions and compiled data for dispersal distances together with information about the dispersal mode and plant traits. Based on this information, we identified seven "dispersal types" with similar dispersal distances. For each type, upper limits for the distance within which 50{\%} and 99{\%} of a species' seeds will disperse were estimated with the 80(th) percentile of the available values. These distances varied 5000-fold among the seven dispersal types, but generally less than 50-fold within the types. Thus, our dispersal types represented a large part of the variation in observed dispersal distances. The attribution of a dispersal type to a particular species only requires information that is already available in databases for most Central European species, i.e. dispersal vector (e.g. wind, animals), the precise mode of dispersal (e.g. dyszoochory, epizoochory), and species traits influencing the efficiency of dispersal (e.g. plant height, typical habitats). This typology could be extended to other regions and will make it possible to include seed dispersal in species distribution models.},

abstract = {Individuals that disperse from one habitat to another has consequences for individual fitness, population dynamics and gene flow. The fitness benefits accrued in the new habitat are traded off against costs associated with dispersal. Most studies focus on costs at settlement and effects on settlement populations; the influence of dispersal to natal populations is assessed by monitoring change in numbers due to emigration. However, the extent to which natal populations are affected when individuals that invest in dispersal fail to disperse/emigrate is unclear. Here, we use an Integral Projection Model (IPM) to assess how developing into a disperser affects natal population structure and growth. We do so using the bulb mite (Rhizoglyphus robini) as a study system. Bulb mites, in unfavourable environments, develop into a dispersal (deutonymph) stage during ontogeny; these individuals are called dispersers with individuals not developing into this stage called non-dispersers. We varied disperser expression and parameterised IPMs to describe three simulations of successful and unsuccessful dispersal: (i) ‘no dispersal' - dispersal stage is excluded and demographic data are from non-disperser individuals; (ii) ‘false dispersal' - dispersal stage included and demographic data from non-disperser individuals are used; (iii) ‘true dispersal' - dispersal stage included and demographic data are from individuals that go through the dispersal stage and from non-disperser individuals. We found that the type of dispersal simulation (no dispersal {\textless} false dispersal {\textless} true dispersal) and disperser expression increases generation time and reduces lifetime reproductive success and population growth rate. Our findings show that disperser individuals that fail to leave, can change the structure and growth of natal populations.},

abstract = {AimsIn situ species survival involves persistence at current sites and/or colonization of new locations. Determining the likelihood of these events requires an understanding of population dynamics and dispersal. We address these issues in populations of a critically endangered tropical conifer Araucaria nemorosa and provide conservation recommendations. Location Port Boise, island of Grand Terre, New Caledonia, Pacific Ocean. Methods We characterize the demographic structure of six populations of A. nemorosa based upon size class frequencies and relative basal area compared to competing angiosperm trees. Using genotype data from 280 adult individuals at seven microsatellite loci, we indirectly estimate dispersal distances and project a maximal dispersal envelope around the extant populations. Results Our survey detected marked differences in demographic parameters including the proportion of basal area occupied by A. nemorosa versus angiosperm trees (ranging from 25{\%} to 77{\%}), the size class frequency distributions of A. nemorosa and seedling densities (ranging from 500 to 37300 seedlings ha−1) among some populations. Wright's genetic neighbourhood ranged from 22 to 876 trees, and historic gene dispersal ranged from 10.8 to 82.4 m, indicating that most seed dispersal is {\textless}100 m. Main conclusions This study indicates that the risk of recruitment failure in remnant populations of Araucaria nemorosa is low in most of the stands but is high in the inland population For{\^{e}}t Nord. In situ natural regeneration appears to be constrained in this population, most likely as a consequence of competitive exclusion. Our results also suggest that the majority of seed dispersal is too short to allow A. nemorosa to disperse to new more hospitable sites within an ecologically relevant time-scale. Our findings have implications not only for this emblematic tree species but also for a wide range of fragmented and degraded plant species populations with limited dispersal that are vulnerable to competitive exclusion.},

The results demonstrated that there was a small regeneration ratio and the sexual ratio was around 1:1, as previously expected for the species.

abstract = {Forest ecosystems in the United States (U.S.) are facing major challenges such as climate change, exotic species invasions, and landscape fragmentation. It is widely believed that forest composition in the eastern U.S. is transitioning from shade-intolerant, fire-tolerant species to shade-tolerant, fire-intolerant species, but most evidence is anecdotal or localized. No comprehensive studies exist to quantify the shifts in forest composition across multiple genera at a regional scale. Here, we examined the genus-level compositional changes in eastern U.S. forests to: (1) quantify the extent and magnitude of this transition, and (2) assess the influence of shade and fire tolerance traits on abundance change. Genus-level data were compiled from the Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) database across 37 states in the eastern U.S. for the last three decades. We analyzed shifts in forest composition with three metrics—stem density, basal area, and importance value—for 10 of the most abundant genera (Acer, Betula, Carya, Fraxinus, Nyssa, Pinus, Populus, Prunus, Quercus, and Ulmus). In addition, we estimated density-weighted fire and shade tolerances for each genus using species-level published data, assessed the shifts in spatial patterns of these traits, and analyzed the associations between these traits and county-level abundance changes. In general, Acer, Fraxinus, Pinus, and Prunus increased in abundance during the study period. Acer experienced the largest increase in abundance across the study area. In contrast, Carya, Nyssa, Quercus and Ulmus decreased in abundance in the majority of the study region, with Quercus having the largest and most extensive decline. Although density-weighted shade and fire tolerances were correlated at the genus level, shade tolerance was a better predictor of genus-level abundance change than fire tolerance. Traits of fire and shade tolerance are not always interchangeable when used to predict the dynamics of a genus, and management decision making based on traits should focus at the species level when possible. Our analyses provide evidence that forest composition has shifted in the last three decades in the eastern United States across multiple genera, and the shifts are more closely related to species' shade tolerance than fire tolerance.},

abstract = {Abstract The coexistence of competing species depends on the balance between their fitness differences, which determine their competitive inequalities, and their niche differences, which stabilise their competitive interactions. Darwin proposed that evolution causes species' niches to diverge, but the influence of evolution on relative fitness differences, and the importance of both niche and fitness differences in determining coexistence have not yet been studied together. We tested whether the phylogenetic distances between species of green freshwater algae determined their abilities to coexist in a microcosm experiment. We found that niche differences were more important in explaining coexistence than relative fitness differences, and that phylogenetic distance had no effect on either coexistence or on the sizes of niche and fitness differences. These results were corroborated by an analysis of the frequency of the co-occurrence of 325 pairwise combinations of algal taxa in {\textgreater} 1100 lakes across North America. Phylogenetic distance may not explain the coexistence of freshwater green algae.},

abstract = {Roadsides are preferential migration corridors for invasive plant species and can act as starting points for plant invasions into adjacent habitats. Rapid spread and interrupted distribution patterns of introduced plant species indicate long-distance dispersal along roads. The extent to which this process is due to species' migration along linear habitats or, alternatively, to seed transport by vehicles has not yet been tested systematically. We tested this by sampling seeds inside long motorway tunnels to exclude nontraffic dispersal. Vehicles transported large amounts of seeds. The annual seed rain caused by vehicles on the roadsides of five different tunnel lanes within three tunnels along a single urban motorway in Berlin, Germany, ranged from 635 to 1579 seeds/m(2)/year. Seeds of non-native species accounted for 50.0{\%} of the 204 species and 54.4{\%} of the total 11,818 seeds trapped inside the tunnels. Among the samples were 39 (19.1{\%}) highly invasive species that exhibit detrimental effects on native biodiversity in some parts of the world. By comparing the flora in the tunnel with that adjacent to the tunnel entrances we confirmed long-distance dispersal events ({\textgreater}250 m) for 32.3{\%} of the sampled species. Seed sources in a radius of 100 m around the entrances of the tunnels had no significant effect on species richness and species composition of seed samples from inside the tunnels, indicating a strong effect of long-distance dispersal by vehicles. Consistently, the species composition of the tunnel seeds was more similar to the regional roadside flora of Berlin than to the local flora around the tunnel entrances. Long-distance dispersal occurred significantly more frequently in seeds of non-native (mean share 38.5{\%}) than native species (mean share 4.1{\%}). Our results showed that long-distance dispersal by vehicles was a routine rather than an occasional mechanism. Dispersal of plants by vehicles will thus accelerate plant invasions and induce rapid changes in biodiversity patterns.},

abstract = {Biological diversity could enhance ecosystem service provision by increasing the mean level of services provided, and/or by providing more consistent (stable) services over space and time. Ecological theory predicts that when an ecosystem service is provided by many species, it will be stabilized against disturbance by a variety of 'stabilizing mechanisms.' However, few studies have investigated whether stabilizing mechanisms occur in real landscapes affected by human disturbance. We used two datasets on crop pollination by wild native bees to screen for and differentiate among three stabilizing mechanisms: density compensation (negative co-variance among species' abundances); response diversity (differential response to environmental variables among species); and cross-scale resilience (response to the same environmental variable at different scales by different species). In both datasets, we found response diversity and cross-scale resilience, but not density compensation. We conclude that stabilizing mechanisms may contribute to the stability of pollination services in our study areas, emphasizing the insurance value of seemingly 'redundant' species. Furthermore, the absence of density compensation that we found at the landscape scale contrasts with findings of previous small-scale experimental and modelling work, suggesting that we should not assume that density compensation will stabilize ecosystem services in real landscapes.},

abstract = {In hyper fragmented biomes, conservation of extant biota relies on preservation and proper management of remnants. The maintenance of genetic diversity and functional connectivity in a landscape context is probably key to long-term conservation of remnant populations. We measured the genetic diversity in seedlings and adults of tree Copaifera langsdorffii and evaluated whether edge and density-dependent effects drive natural regeneration in a set of very small and degraded Brazilian Atlantic forest fragments. We evaluated the role of small remnants in the conservation of genetic diversity in a hyper fragmented landscape and discuss the challenge of long-term population sustainability of such altered habitats. High genetic diversity in adults indicated these fragments are valuable targets for C. langsdorffii in situ conservation, but both genetic diversity and divergence among patches decreased in seedlings. In our landscape, regeneration increased as it neared edges and adults; suggesting this population is resilient to fragmentation. However, at a broader scale, current levels of gene flow have not been sufficient to prevent the loss of genetic diversity across generations. Restoration plans, even at a small scale, are necessary to promote fragment connectivity and spatially expand opportunities for the fairly restricted gene flow observed in this severely fragmented Brazilian Atlantic forest region.},

We also quantified current land use, i.e. grazing by domestic animals, and selective logging. Caatinga vegetation structure, measured as vegetation cover, vegetation height, basal area and woody plant density, as well as recruitment, measured as woody plant seedling density and species richness, were negatively affected by both past and current land use. Past clear-cut not only had strong effects on most vegetation measures, but also increased current grazing which further negatively affected vegetation structure. Selective logging had little measurable effects but increased recruitment in plots previously clear-cut. Increasing time since the last clear-cut increased negative effects on vegetation, presumably because of a prolonged negative effect of grazing. Our results suggest that grazing needs to be prevented in areas degraded by clear-cut to allow vegetation restoration through natural succession and avoid further degradation and desertification.},

Winter wheat producers in the western United States are concerned about the lack of adequate selective control measures for this weed. Jointed goatgrass and wheat share the D chromosome in common and have similar growth habits. Jointed goatgrass lowers winter wheat yield by competing for growth requirements, reducing harvesting efficiency, and lowering crop quality by contaminating harvested grain. Jointed goatgrass is well adapted to stubble-mulch or reduced tillage crop production, particularly in regions where climate limits cropping options to the winter wheat-fallow rotation or continuous wheat. This review summarizes jointed goatgrass seed germination, dormancy, physiology, yield loss estimates in winter wheat, and both herbicidal and non-chemical methods of managing jointed goatgrass.},

abstract = {Biotic interactions are central to both ecological and evolutionary dynamics. In the vast majority of empirical studies, the strength of intraspecific interactions is estimated by using simple measures of population size. Biologists have long known that these are crude metrics, with experiments and theory suggesting that interactions between individuals should depend on traits, such as body size. Despite this, it has been difficult to estimate the impact of traits on competitive ability from ecological field data, and this explains why the strength of biotic interactions has empirically been treated in a simplistic manner. Using long-term observational data from four different populations, we show that large Trinidadian guppies impose a significantly larger competitive pressure on conspecifics than individuals that are smaller; in other words, competition is asymmetric. When we incorporate this asymmetry into integral projection models, the predicted size structure is much closer to what we see in the field compared with models where competition is independent of body size. This difference in size structure translates into a twofold difference in reproductive output. This demonstrates how the nature of ecological interactions drives the size structure, which, in turn, will have important implications for both the ecological and evolutionary dynamics.},

These structures can give rise to complex population dynamics and interact with environmental conditions. Here we present a model for continuously structured populations with finite size, including both demographic and environmental stochasticity in the dynamics. Using recent methods developed for discrete age-structured models we derive the demographic and environmental variance of the population growth as functions of a continuous state variable. These two parameters, together with the expected population growth rate, are used to define a one-dimensional diffusion approximation of the population dynamics. Thus, a substantial reduction in complexity is achieved as the dynamics of the complex structured model can be described by only three population parameters. We provide methods for numerical calculation of the model parameters and demonstrate the accuracy of the diffusion approximation by computer simulation of specific examples. The general modeling framework makes it possible to analyze and predict future dynamics and extinction risk of populations with various types of structure, and to explore consequences of changes in demography caused by, e.g., climate change or different management decisions. Our results are especially relevant for small populations that are often of conservation concern.},

A number of new methods, among them Approximate Bayesian Computing and Pattern-Oriented Modelling, bypass this limitation. These methods share three main principles: aggregation of simulated and observed data via summary statistics, likelihood approximation based on the summary statistics, and efficient sampling. We discuss principles as well as advantages and caveats of these methods, and demonstrate their potential for integrating stochastic simulation models into a unified framework for statistical modelling.},

abstract = {Although human-driven landscape modification is generally characterized by habitat destruction and fragmentation, it may also result in the creation of new habitat patches, providing conditions conducive to spontaneous colonization. In this article, we propose the concept of " colonization credit" (i.e., the number of species yet to colonize a patch, following landscape changes) as a framework to evaluate the success of colonization, in terms of species richness, in new/restored habitats, taking into account the spatial structure of landscapes. The method mirrors similar approaches used to estimate extinction debt in the context of habitat fragmentation, that is, comparisons, between old and new habitat patches, of the relationships among spatial patch metrics and patch species richness. We applied our method to the case of spontaneous colonization of newly created habitat patches suitable for wet heathland plant communities in South Belgium. Colonization credit was estimated for the total species richness, the specialist species richness, and the species richness of three emergent groups (EGs) of specialist species, delineated on the basis of dispersal traits. No significant colonization credit was identified either in patches created 25-55 years ago or in those created within the past 25 years, with the exception of species from our first EG (mostly anemochorous species with long-term persistent seed bank). However, the differential response of species in that first EG could not be explained through their characteristic life history traits. The results of this study are encouraging and suggest that deliberate, directed restoration activities could yield positive developments in a relatively short period of time. {\textcopyright} 2009 Society for Ecological Restoration International.},

abstract = {Climate change is expected to change the distribution of species. For long-lived, sessile species such as trees, tracking the warming climate depends on seedling colonization of newly favorable areas. We compare the distribution of seedlings and mature trees for all but the rarest tree species in California, Oregon and Washington, United States of America, a large, environmentally diverse region. Across 46 species, the mean annual temperature of the range of seedlings was 0.120°C colder than that of the range of trees (95{\%} confidence interval from 0.096 to 0.144°C). The extremes of the seedling distributions also shifted towards colder temperature than those of mature trees, but the change was less pronounced. Although the mean elevation and mean latitude of the range of seedlings was higher than and north of those of the range of mature trees, elevational and latitudinal shifts run in opposite directions for the majority of the species, reflecting the lack of a direct biological relationship between species' distributions and those variables. The broad scale, environmental diversity and variety of disturbance regimes and land uses of the study area, the large number and exhaustive sampling of tree species, and the direct causal relationship between the temperature response and a warming climate, provide strong evidence to attribute the observed shifts to climate change.},

abstract = {Phenology is a key aspect of plant and animal life strategies that determines the ability to capture seasonally variable resources. It defines the season and duration of growth and reproduction and paces ecological interactions and ecosystem functions. Phenology models have become a key component of models in agronomy, forestry, ecology, and biogeosciences. Plant and ani-mal process-based phenology models have taken different paths that have so far not crossed. Yet, they share many features because plant and animal an-nual cycles also share many characteristics, from their stepwise progression, including a resting period, to their dependence on similar environmental factors. We review the strengths and shortcomings of these models and the divergences in modeling approaches for plants and animals, which are mostly due to specificities of the questions they tackle. Finally, we discuss the most promising avenues and the challenges phenology modeling needs to address in the upcoming years.

abstract = {State-and-transition models (STMs) can represent many different types of landscape change, from simple gradient-driven transitions to complex, (pseudo-) random patterns. While previous applications of STMs have focused on individual states and transitions, this study addresses broader-scale modes of spatial change based on the entire network of states and transitions. STMs are treated as mathematical graphs, and several metrics from algebraic graph theory are applied-spectral radius, algebraic connectivity, and the S-metric. These indicate, respectively, the amplification of environmental change by state transitions, the relative rate of propagation of state changes through the landscape, and the degree of system structural constraints on the spatial propagation of state transitions. The analysis is illustrated by application to the Gualalupe/San Antonio River delta, Texas, with soil types as representations of system states. Concepts of change in deltaic environments are typically based on successional patterns in response to forcings such as sea level change or river inflows. However, results indicate more complex modes of change associated with amplification of changes in system states, relatively rapid spatial propagation of state transitions, and some structural constraints within the system. The implications are that complex, spatially variable state transitions are likely, constrained by local (within-delta) environmental gradients and initial conditions. As in most applications, the STM used in this study is a representation of observed state transitions. While the usual predictive application of STMs is identification of local state changes associated with, e.g., management strategies, the methods presented here show how STMs can be used at a broader scale to identify landscape scale modes of spatial change. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {A forest simulation model has been applied in a regional impact assessment to investigate impacts of climate change on forest structure and function in the Federal state of Brandenburg, Germany. The forest model FORSKA-M was linked to a GIS that included soil, groundwater table and land-use maps. Two climate scenarios (current climate and a climate change of 1.5K temperature increase which is combined with a precipitation decrease of 10–20{\%} on average) for 40 meteorological stations in and around Brandenburg were used to assess the sensitivity of species composition to climate change. Furthermore, the implications of vegetation changes for other forest functions were analysed by means of several indicators. To evaluate the impacts of climate change on biodiversity, measures of species diversity (Shannon's and Simpson's index) and habitat and structural diversity (Seibert's index) were applied. The evaluation of impacts on groundwater recharge of natural and managed forests was carried out using the soil water balance model of FORSKA-M. At first, model simulations of the potential natural vegetation (PNV) on the whole area of Brandenburg with different climate scenarios were analysed. The results indicated that climatic warming would lead to a shift in the natural species composition in Brandenburg towards more drought tolerant species. The simulated diversity of the forests would be reduced, and groundwater recharge would be decreased. The majority of forests in the state of Brandenburg have been managed intensively in the past. At present, large areas of Brandenburg's forests are dominated by pure stands of Scots pine, but current forest management practice aims at increasing the share of deciduous and mixed forests. In order to analyse the possible consequences of climate change on forest management, forest inventory data were used to initialise FORSKA-M with representative forest stands. Simulation experiments with three different management scenarios showed that the short to mid-term effects of climatic change in terms of species composition were not as severe as expected. However, the comparison of different diversity measures indicates a decrease in the species diversity in contrast to an increase in habitat diversity under climate warming. Furthermore, a decrease in productivity and groundwater recharge was simulated under the climate change scenario. The regional impact assessment corroborated the high sensitivity of natural forests in the region to the projected climatic change and it underlined the importance of adaptive management strategies to help forestry to cope with climatic change.},

abstract = {Projected changes in temperature and drought regime are likely to reduce carbon (C) storage in forests, thereby amplifying rates of climate change. While such reductions are often presumed to be greatest in semi-arid forests that experience widespread tree mortality, the consequences of drought may also be important in temperate mesic forests of Eastern North America (ENA) if tree growth is significantly curtailed by drought. Investigations of the environmental conditions that determine drought sensitivity are critically needed to accurately predict ecosystem feedbacks to climate change. We matched site factors with the growth responses to drought of 10,753 trees across mesic forests of ENA, representing 24 species and 346 stands, to determine the broad-scale drivers of drought sensitivity for the dominant trees in ENA. Here we show that two factors – the timing of drought, and the atmospheric demand for water (i.e., local potential evapotranspiration; PET) – are stronger drivers of drought sensitivity than soil and stand characteristics. Across ENA, intraspecific variation in drought sensitivity was equal to or greater than interspecific variation in sensitivity in 17 of 24 species. Drought-induced reductions in tree growth were greatest when the droughts occurred during early-season peaks in radial growth, especially for trees growing in the warmest, driest regions (i.e., highest PET). Further, mean species trait values (rooting depth and Psi50) were poor predictors of drought sensitivity, as intraspecific variation in sensitivity was equal to or greater than interspecific variation in 17 of 24 species. From a general circulation model ensemble, we find that future increases in early-season PET may exacerbate these effects, and potentially offset gains in C uptake and storage in ENA owing to other global change factors.

abstract = {This study investigates patterns of genetic connectivity among 11 co-distributed tropical rainforest tree species from the genus Elaeocarpus across a biogeographic barrier, the Black Mountain Corridor (BMC) in the Australian Wet Tropics (AWT). We analysed a combination of allelic and flanking region sequence data from microsatellite markers, and evaluated the relative influence of environmental preferences and functional traits on genetic diversity and gene flow. The results indicate that only in three species geographic structuring of haplotype distribution reflects a north vs. south of the BMC pattern. Environmental factors linked with altitude were recognized as affecting genetic trends, but the selective processes operating on upland species appear to be associated with competitiveness and regeneration opportunities on poor soil types rather than climate variables alone. In contrast to previous observations within southeastern Australian rainforests, genetic differentiation in the AWT appears to be associated with small-fruited rather than large-fruited species, highlighting how external factors can influence the dispersal dimension. Overall, this study emphasizes the importance of considering functional and environmental factors when attempting generalizations on landscape-level patterns of genetic variation. Understanding how plant functional groups respond to environmental and climatic heterogeneity can help us predict responses to future change. {\textcopyright} 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Environmental changes are expected to alter both the distribution and the abundance of organisms. A disproportionate amount of past work has focused on distribution only, either documenting historical range shifts or predicting future occurrence patterns. However, simultaneous predictions of abundance and distribution across landscapes would be far more useful. To critically assess which approaches represent advances towards the goal of joint predictions of abundance and distribution, we review recent work on changing distributions and on effects of environmental drivers on single populations. Several methods have been used to predict changing distributions. Some of these can be easily modified to also predict abundance, but others cannot. In parallel, demographers have developed a much better understanding of how changing abiotic and biotic drivers will influence growth rate and abundance in single populations. However, this demographic work has rarely taken a landscape perspective and has largely ignored the effects of intraspecific density. We advocate a synthetic approach in which population models accounting for both density dependence and effects of environmental drivers are used to make integrated predictions of equilibrium abundance and distribution across entire landscapes. Such predictions would constitute an important step forward in assessing the ecological consequences of environmental changes.},

abstract = {Ecophylogenetics can be viewed as an emerging fusion of ecology, biogeography and macroevolution. This new and fast-growing field is promoting the incorporation of evolution and historical contingencies into the ecological research agenda through the widespread use of phylogenetic data. Including phylogeny into ecological thinking represents an opportunity for biologists from different fields to collaborate and has provided promising avenues of research in both theoretical and empirical ecology, towards a better understanding of the assembly of communities, the functioning of ecosystems and their responses to environmental changes. The time is ripe to assess critically the extent to which the integration of phylogeny into these different fields of ecology has delivered on its promise. Here we review how phylogenetic information has been used to identify better the key components of species interactions with their biotic and abiotic environments, to determine the relationships between diversity and ecosystem functioning and ultimately to establish good management practices to protect overall biodiversity in the face of global change. We evaluate the relevance of information provided by phylogenies to ecologists, highlighting current potential weaknesses and needs for future developments. We suggest that despite the strong progress that has been made, a consistent unified framework is still missing to link local ecological dynamics to macroevolution. This is a necessary step in order to interpret observed phylogenetic patterns in a wider ecological context. Beyond the fundamental question of how evolutionary history contributes to shape communities, ecophylogenetics will help ecology to become a better integrative and predictive science.},

abstract = {Forest dynamics are highly dimensional phenomena that are not fully understood theoretically. Forest inventory datasets offer unprecedented opportunities to model these dynamics, but they are analytically challenging due to high dimensionality and sampling irregularities across years. We develop a data-intensive methodology for predicting forest stand dynamics using such datasets. Our methodology involves the following steps: 1) computing stand level characteristics from individual tree measurements, 2) reducing the characteristic dimensionality through analyses of their correlations, 3) parameterizing transition matrices for each uncorrelated dimension using Gibbs sampling, and 4) deriving predictions of forest developments at different timescales. Applying our methodology to a forest inventory database from Quebec, Canada, we discovered that four uncorrelated dimensions were required to describe the stand structure: the biomass, biodiversity, shade tolerance index and stand age. We were able to successfully estimate transition matrices for each of these dimensions. The model predicted substantial short-term increases in biomass and longer-term increases in the average age of trees, biodiversity, and shade intolerant species. Using highly dimensional and irregularly sampled forest inventory data, our original data-intensive methodology provides both descriptions of the short-term dynamics as well as predictions of forest development on a longer timescale. This method can be applied in other contexts such as conservation and silviculture, and can be delivered as an efficient tool for sustainable forest management.},

We present a suite of formulae for the second derivatives of each growth rate and show how to compute these derivatives with respect to projection matrix entries and to lower-level parameters affecting those matrix entries.

Also, there has been an increased recognition that the problem of scale at which ecological processes should be considered is critical if we are to produce general predictions. Ecological dynamics is always stochastic at small scales, but variability is conditional on the scale of description. The radical changes in the scope and aims of ecology over the past decades reflect in part the need to address pressing societal issues of environmental change. Technological advances in molecular biology, global positioning, sensing instrumentation and computational power should not be overlooked as an explanation for these radical changes. However, I argue that conceptual unification across ecology, genetics, evolution and physiology has fostered even more fertile questions. We are moving away from the view that evolution is played in a fixed ecological theatre: the theatre is being rapidly and relentlessly redesigned by the players themselves. The maintenance of ecosystem functions depends on shifts in species assemblages and on cellular metabolism, not only on flows of energy and matter. These findings have far reaching implications for our understanding of how ecosystem function and biodiversity will withstand (or not) environmental changes in the 21st century.},

Current methods that predict climate-driven species' range shifts use ecological modelling without eco-evolutionary dynamics. Here we present an eco-evolutionary forecasting framework that combines niche modelling with individual-based demographic and genetic simulations. Applying our approach to four endemic perennial plant species of the Austrian Alps, we show that accounting for eco-evolutionary dynamics when predicting species' responses to climate change is crucial. Perennial species persist in unsuitable habitats longer than predicted by niche modelling, causing delayed range losses; however, their evolutionary responses are constrained because long-lived adults produce increasingly maladapted offspring. Decreasing population size due to maladaptation occurs faster than the contraction of the species range, especially for the most abundant species. Monitoring of species' local abundance rather than their range may likely better inform on species' extinction risks under climate change.},

The main goal of the present work was to describe the demographic structure of a natural A. angustifolia population. Therefore, the population studied was divided into four classes based on stage and gender: regeneration, juveniles, males and females. The diametric and height structures, sexual ratio, spatial and dependence patterns were evaluated. The results demonstrated that there was a small regeneration ratio and the sexual ratio was around 1:1, as previously expected for the species. In the spatial pattern analysis, aggregation groups appear in all classes studied. The regeneration showed clusters that do not seem to be associated to adult specimens. The natural regeneration occurs, but in low density under forest conditions.},

abstract = {Despite emerging evidence that on-going climate change is affecting species physiology, distribution, and phenology, there are few studies that examine changes in tree sapling establishment as a response. Changes in tree species composition can be expected due to increasing temperatures, with subsequent effects on future forest compositions. This study's objective was to examine changes in relative density of tree species assemblages within powerline corridors from 1975 to 2003 in New York State. Powerline corridors in New York are commonly surrounded by forests, which creates constant tree invasion pressure within a perpetual old-field environment. This unique combination of factors allowed us to examine tree sapling establishment in a nearly constant environment over a 28-year period, utilizing MANOVA and PCA as primary statistical analyses. Tree species dynamics varied across the four ecological provinces within New York over time. Northern pioneer species (Betula populifolia, Fraxinus americana, Prunus serotina, and Tilia americana) declined across the state over the past 28 years, while the southern pioneer species (Betula lenta, Liriodendron tulipifera, and Sassafras albidum) increased in the hot continental division. In the warm continental division, the pine-hemlock assemblage increased in the Northeastern Mixed Forest Province, while aspen-birch increased in the Adirondack Highlands Forest Province, likely due to increases in precipitation. It appears that climate change may have had some influence on tree sapling composition that could affect future vegetation management decisions and expectations in powerline rights-of-way and forests.},

Using the data from over 690 000 individual trees I estimated five demographic rates - canopy growth, understorey growth, canopy lifespan, understorey lifespan and per capita reproduction - for 19 common eastern US tree species, within the core and the northern and southern boundaries, of the species range. Most species showed statistically significant boundary versus core differences in most rates at both boundary types. Differences in canopy and understorey growth were relatively small in magnitude but consistent among species, being lower at the northern (average -17{\%}) and higher at the southern (average +12{\%}) boundaries. Differences in lifespan were larger in magnitude but highly variable among species, except for a marked trend for reduced canopy lifespan at the northern boundary (average -49{\%}). Differences in per capita reproduction were large and statistically significant for some species, but highly variable among species. The rate estimates were combined to calculate two performance indices: R0 (a measure of lifetime fitness in the absence of competition) was consistently lower at the northern boundary (average -86{\%}) whereas Z* (a measure of competitive ability in closed forest) showed no sign of a consistent boundary-core difference at either boundary. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Royal Society.},

abstract = {Habitat destruction has driven many once-contiguous animal populations into remnant patches of varying size and isolation. The underlying framework for the conservation of fragmented populations is founded on the principles of island biogeography, wherein the probability of species occurrence in habitat patches varies as a function of patch size and isolation. Despite decades of research, the general importance of patch area and isolation as predictors of species occupancy in fragmented terrestrial systems remains unknown because of a lack of quantitative synthesis. Here, we compile occupancy data from 1,015 bird, mammal, reptile, amphibian, and invertebrate population networks on 6 continents and show that patch area and isolation are surprisingly poor predictors of occupancy for most species. We examine factors such as improper scaling and biases in species representation as explanations and find that the type of land cover separating patches most strongly affects the sensitivity of species to patch area and isolation. Our results indicate that patch area and isolation are indeed important factors affecting the occupancy of many species, but properties of the intervening matrix should not be ignored. Improving matrix quality may lead to higher conservation returns than manipulating the size and configuration of remnant patches for many of the species that persist in the aftermath of habitat destruction.},

However, following primary seed dispersal, some seeds are transported intact by ants, dung beetles, scatter-hoarding animals, or abiotic processes to new microsites (secondary dispersal) where germination is possible. Despite a growing realization that secondary seed dispersal can play an important role in plant recruitment, many researchers continue to use seed removal as a proxy for seed predation and are focused too intently on only the initial step of seed fate. We describe, using examples from the recent literature, how the results of some seed removal studies may have been misinterpreted, present plau- sible, alternative explanations for the fate of seeds in those studies, and discuss the im- portance of detailed studies of seed fates.

abstract = {This paper reviews the literature concerning the spatial distribution of weeds; highlighting the limitations of our current sampling and analytical methodologies, and suggesting how these inadequacies can be addressed. Most research studies have used discrete sampling, i.e. weeds are counted within a quadrat, on a grid basis. Few have mapped weeds at a whole-{\textregistered}eld scale, either with a resolution appropriate to spraying operations or key ecological processes. Statistical analyses used to describe the data can be divided into two main types, spatially implicit (also at the scale of the sampling unit) or spatially explicit, in which the location of individuals is included in the analyses. Spatially implicit methods can be strongly a ected by quadrat size and mean density and are of doubtful benefit. More attention is required to address sampling resolution issues for spatially explicit methods. Our understanding of the formation and dynamics of spatial pattern, as well as predicting the consequences of site-speci{\textregistered}c management, can be improved with models. Unfortunately, most models consider only newly expanding patches and appear incapable of predicting spatial distributions when an area has been fully invaded. More detailed biological information is required if models are to become more realistic and informative. We also need to ensure that we understand the spatial processes in the context of the whole {\textregistered}eld environment, to optimize the success of site-speci{\textregistered}c weed management in the longer term.},

abstract = {Human actions challenge nature in many ways. Ecological responses are ineluctably complex, demanding measures that describe them succinctly. Collectively, these measures encapsulate the overall ‘stability' of the system. Many international bodies, including the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, broadly aspire to maintain or enhance ecological stability. Such bodies frequently use terms pertaining to stability that lack clear definition. Consequently, we cannot measure them and so they disconnect from a large body of theoretical and empirical understanding. We assess the scientific and policy literature and show that this disconnect is one consequence of an inconsistent and one-dimensional approach that ecologists have taken to both disturbances and stability. This has led to confused communication of the nature of stability and the level of our insight into it. Disturbances and stability are multidimensional. Our understanding of them is not. We have a remarkably poor understanding of the impacts on stability of the characteristics that define many, perhaps all, of the most important elements of global change. We provide recommendations for theoreticians, empiricists and policymakers on how to better integrate the multidimensional nature of ecological stability into their research, policies and actions.},

I argue that it is useful to define Grinnellian and Eltonian niches on the basis of the types of variables used to calculate them, the natural spatial scale at which they can be measured, and the dispersal of the individuals over the environment. I use set theory notation and analogies derived from population ecology theory to obtain formal definitions of areas of distribution and several types of niches.

Before the ice storm, most microsites received between 2 and 4{\%}PPFD. Following the ice storm, the stand-level mean {\%}PPFD increased four- to five-fold, ranging from 13.8 to 20.5{\%}PPFD, from 0.3 to 4 m aboveground. Despite its magnitude, the post-ice storm increase in light transmission was short-lived. By 1999 (2-year+), the mean light levels had decreased by half, and recovery to pre-storm conditions occurred within 3-7 years, depending on height. The decrease in light transmission during the post-disturbance years followed an inverse J-shape trend, indicating more dynamic changes early after disturbance. By 2004 (7-year+), light levels at ???2 m had become slightly but significantly lower than before the ice storm, with most microsites receiving {\textless}2{\%}PPFD. The ice storm led to a synchronized increase of the light levels at almost all understory locations, which might allow a high proportion of the advanced regeneration to experience a release. However, due to the rapid recovery of the light conditions to levels similar or lower than before the ice storm, this disturbance should be more advantageous to shade-tolerant species. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

We found that species abundance accurately predicts network metrics at all levels.

abstract = {Overhunting in tropical forests reduces populations of vertebrate seed dispersers. If reduced seed dispersal has a negative impact on tree population viability, overhunting could lead to altered forest structure and dynamics, including decreased biodiversity. However, empirical data showing decreased animal-dispersed tree abundance in overhunted forests contradict demographic models which predict minimal sensitivity of tree population growth rate to early life stages. One resolution to this discrepancy is that seed dispersal determines spatial aggregation, which could have demographic consequences for all life stages. We tested the impact of dispersal loss on population viability of a tropical tree species, Miliusa horsfieldii, currently dispersed by an intact community of large mammals in a Thai forest. We evaluated the effect of spatial aggregation for all tree life stages, from seeds to adult trees, and constructed simulation models to compare population viability with and without animal-mediated seed dispersal. In simulated populations, disperser loss increased spatial aggregation by fourfold, leading to increased negative density dependence across the life cycle and a 10-fold increase in the probability of extinction. Given that the majority of tree species in tropical forests are animal-dispersed, overhunting will potentially result in forests that are fundamentally different from those existing now.},

The study area is a Brazilian National Forest in southern Brazil, established in the 1950s. Genetic analysis was investigated using nine allozyme loci. Significant and positive fixation index was detected for the adults of all studied populations. Although we observed lower levels of genetic diversity and biparental inbreeding in some populations, their pattern of mating, similar to that expected in panmixia, indicates that all populations can be used in conservation planning. Furthermore, the presence of unique alleles and the significant genetic differentiation among all adult populations (F ST = 0.404) reinforces that all populations are important conservation resources. The average paternity correlation was high in almost all populations, showing that open-pollinated families are composed of mixtures of half- and full-sibs. With regards to conservation strategies, our results suggest that seed collection from at least 133 seed trees is necessary to retain a reference effective population size of 500. Our results confirm that the planted Araucaria forests in southern Brazil can be useful as a genetic resource for conservation, breeding and reforestation strategies for this threatened species. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

We propose an integrative framework linking ecological theory, empirical data and statistical models to understand the distribution of species and their abundances together with the underlying community assembly dynamics. We illustrate our approach with 21 plant species in the French Alps. We show that a spatially nested modelling framework significantly improves the model's performance and that the spatial variations of species presence-absence and abundances are predominantly explained by different factors. We also show that incorporating abiotic, dispersal and biotic factors into the same model bring new insights to our understanding of community assembly. This approach, at the crossroads between community ecology and biogeography, is a promising avenue for a better understanding of species co-existence and biodiversity distribution. {\textcopyright} 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

We reviewed 594 published paleoecological records to examine compositional and structural changes in terrestrial vegetation since the last glacial period and to project the magnitudes of ecosystem transformations under alternative future emission scenarios. Our results indicate that terrestrial ecosystems are highly sensitive to temperature change and suggest that, without major reductions in greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere, terrestrial ecosystems worldwide are at risk of major transformation, with accompanying disruption of ecosystem services and impacts on biodiversity.},

abstract = {![Figure][1]{\textless}/img{\textgreater} Pine beetle infestations driven by climate change can lead to deforestation. PHOTO: ALL CANADA PHOTOS/ALAMY STOCK PHOTO In their Report “Classifying drivers of global forest loss” (14 September, p. [1108][2]), P. G. Curtis et al. reported a global assessment of forest loss from 2001 to 2015. They attributed 99{\%} of the loss to land-use change and wildfire, and they urge companies to eliminate 5 million hectares of land-use change per year to prevent further deforestation. Their analysis underestimates climate change–driven drought, storms, and insect epidemics, which also contribute to substantial tree mortality each year. During the period Curtis et al. investigated (2001 to 2015), climate change–driven forest loss increased, affecting large forest areas across the globe ([ 1 ][3]). Growing evidence shows that increasingly hot droughts killed most of the trees in an area of 1.2 million hectares in southwest North America ([ 2 ][4]), and warming-driven mountain pine beetle outbreaks affected forests in northwest North America at a rate of 6 to 7 million hectares per year between 2005 and 2008 ([ 3 ][5]). Additional forest losses of large magnitude due to drought, ice, snow, and wind storms occurred in China, Spain, Chile, and other countries ([ 1 ][3]). The order of magnitude of these forest loss events is similar to the estimated deforestation rate of 5 million hectares a year reported by Curtis et al. One potential cause of the substantial underestimation of climate change–driven forest loss is our limited ability to detect it with remote sensing tools ([ 4 ][6]), which Curtis et al. used for their analysis. Unlike most land-use change forest losses and wildfire, climate change–driven tree mortality is often diffuse and gradual. Although measurements on the ground are sufficient to infer that climate change has caused tree loss [e.g., ([ 1 ][3]–[ 3 ][5])], algorithms and analysis tools that rely on remote sensing data are still under development. In some cases, Curtis et al. 's analysis places climate change–induced changes in other categories. For example, they attributed both mountain pine beetle damage in Canada ([ 3 ][5]) and drought-induced tree mortality near Los Alamos, New Mexico ([ 2 ][4]), and Beetle Rock, California ([ 1 ][3]), to forestry. The analysis presented by Curtis et al. provides only a partial view of the magnitude and causality of global forest loss. Ground-based data from national forest inventories and research plot networks, combined with improved remote sensing image analysis, are essential to identify diffuse forest losses due to climate change. Given that global temperatures continue to rise and droughts are expected to occur more frequently and with higher severity ([ 5 ][7]), quantifying and monitoring these forest losses could potentially become even more important than controlling man-made deforestation. 1.

abstract = {Tree species are predicted to track future climate by shifting their geographic distributions, but climate-mediated migrations are not apparent in a recent continental-scale analysis. To better understand the mechanisms of a possible migration lag, we analyzed relative recruitment patterns by comparing juvenile and adult tree abundances in climate space. One would expect relative recruitment to be higher in cold and dry climates as a result of tree migration with juveniles located further poleward than adults. Alternatively, relative recruitment could be higher in warm and wet climates as a result of higher tree population turnover with increased temperature and precipitation. Using the USDA Forest Service's Forest Inventory and Analysis data at regional scales, we jointly modeled juvenile and adult abundance distributions for 65 tree species in climate space of the eastern United States. We directly compared the optimal climate conditions for juveniles and adults, identified the climates where each species has high relative recruitment, and synthesized relative recruitment patterns across species. Results suggest that for 77{\%} and 83{\%} of the tree species, juveniles have higher optimal temperature and optimal precipitation, respectively, than adults. Across species, the relative recruitment pattern is dominated by relatively more abundant juveniles than adults in warm and wet climates. These different abundance-climate responses through life history are consistent with faster population turnover and inconsistent with the geographic trend of large-scale tree migration. Taken together, this juvenile-adult analysis suggests that tree species might respond to climate change by having faster turnover as dynamics accelerate with longer growing seasons and higher temperatures, before there is evidence of poleward migration at biogeographic scales.},

@article{Gravel_2014,
abstract = {The metacommunity perspective appears as an appropriate conceptual framework to make ecology more predictive. It is particularly relevant to limnology, where exchanges of organisms and nutrients affect community and ecosystem properties from the local to the regional scales. The recent development of neutral theory appears as a step back in that direction because of the assumption of ecological equivalence and the absence of any effect of the environment on community organization. A remarkable strength of neutral theory is nonetheless to provide a general theory of diversity that accounts for a wide range of empirical observations. In this paper, we argue that neutral theory can be useful to understand the impact of dispersal on community assembly in landscapes of various complexities. Our analysis focus on spatially explicit landscapes conceptualized as networks of local communities ( e.g ., lakes) connected to each other by dispersal channels ( e. g., rivers). The main objective of the paper is to use neutral theory to stress the importance of landscape structure on the distribution of diversity. We refer to the landscape organization as a spatial contingency that could potentially affect the coexistence mechanisms at play. We briefly review the main approaches to describe spatial networks and describe three simple toy models of metacommunity dynamics. We take this opportunity to review their assumptions and main predictions. We then conduct simulations of these models to reveal with simple examples the impact of spatial network structure on diversity distribution. The simulation results show that competitive interactions buffer the potential impact of landscape structure. The strongest relationship between node position in the landscape and species richness was observed for the patch dynamics model without any interactions. On the other hand, strong and unequal competitive interactions minimized the effect of node position. We conclude that the neutral model is a useful tool to understand the joint effects of dispersal and ecological interactions. Our analysis shows that limnologists must now integrate more realistic landscapes when analyzing community assembly from a metacommunity perspective.},

abstract = {The world is changing at an unprecedented rate. In such a situation, we need to understand the nature of the change and to make predictions about the way in which it might affect systems of interest; often we may also wish to understand what might be done to mitigate the predicted effects. In ecology, we usually make such predictions (or forecasts) by making use of mathematical models that describe the system and projecting them into the future, under changed conditions. Approaches emphasizing the desirability of simple models with analytical tractability and those that use assumed causal relationships derived statistically from data currently dominate ecological modelling. Although such models are excellent at describing the way in which a system has behaved, they are poor at predicting its future state, especially in novel conditions. In order to address questions about the impact of environmental change, and to understand what, if any, action might be taken to ameliorate it, ecologists need to develop the ability to project models into novel, future conditions. This will require the development of models based on understanding the processes that result in a system behaving the way it does, rather than relying on a description of the system, as a whole, remaining valid indefinitely.},

abstract = {With climate change, favorable growing conditions for tree species are shifting northwards and to higher altitudes. Therefore, local populations are becoming less adapted to their environment. Assisted migration is one of the proposed adaptive measures to reduce the vulnerability of natural populations and maintain forest productivity. It consists of moving genetic material to a territory where future climate conditions correspond to those of its current location. Eight white spruce (Picea glauca [Moench] Voss) seed sources representing as many seed orchards were planted in 2013 at three forest sites simulating a south-north climatic gradient of 1.7°C in Qu{\'{e}}bec, Canada. The objectives were to (1) evaluate the morpho-physiological responses of the different seed sources and (2) determine the role of genetic adaptation and physiological plasticity on the observed variation in morpho-physiological traits. Various seedling characteristics were measured, notably height growth from nursery to the fourth year on plantation. Other traits such as biomass and carbon allocation, nutritional status, and various photosynthetic traits before bud break, were evaluated during the fourth growing season. No interaction between sites and seed sources was observed for any traits, suggesting similar plasticity between seed sources. There was no change in the rank of seed sources and sites between years for height growth. Moreover, a significant positive correlation was observed between the height from the nursery and that after 4 years in the plantation. Southern seed sources showed the best height growth, while optimum growth was observed at the central site. Juvenile height growth seems to be a good indicator of the juvenile carbon sequestration and could serve as a selection criterion for the best genetics sources for carbon sequestration. Vector analysis showed no nitrogen deficiency 4 years after planting. Neither seed sources nor planting sites had a significant effect on photosynthesis before bud break. The observed results during the establishment phase under different site conditions indicate that southern seed sources may already benefit from assisted migration to cooler climatic conditions further north. While northern seed sources are likely to benefit from anticipated local global warming, they would not match the growth performance of seedlings from southern sources.},

abstract = {Competition plays an important role in shaping species' spatial distributions. However, it remains unclear where and how competition regulates species' range limits. In a field experiment with plants originating from low and high elevations and conducted across an elevation gradient in the Swiss Alps, we find that both lowland and highland species can better persist in the presence of competition within, rather than beyond, their elevation ranges. These findings suggest that competition helps set both lower and upper elevation range limits of these species. Furthermore, the reduced ability of pairs of lowland or highland species to coexist beyond their range edges is mainly driven by diminishing niche differences; changes in both niche differences and relative fitness differences drive weakening competitive dominance of lowland over highland species with increasing elevation. These results highlight the need to account for competitive interactions and investigate underlying coexistence mechanisms to understand current and future species distributions.},

abstract = {'Ratadas' are rodent irruptions or outbreaks that have been recorded in South America since the Spanish conquest in the 16th century. The notion that ratadas are associated with bamboo flowering and subsequent mast seeding at cycles of 30 years has appeared in the literature since the late 1800s. Based on 63 well-documented cases, we show that not only are ratadas associated with bamboo blooming, but also many are associated with rainfall peaks, and that these two outbreak types are geographically interspersed over South America. In addition, we dispel the notion that South American bamboo blooms occur every 30 years, which may only be the case for Merostachys fistulosa . For other species the modal cycles occur every 14 (Merostachys spp.), 12 (Chusquea quila and/or valdiviensis) or 14 years (Chusquea coleou). We also propose the hypothesis that rainfall-associated ratadas are ultimately caused by the occurrence of El Nino, and discuss the possible population dynamic mechanisms underlying rodent outbreaks in South America. Aiming at setting a standardized framework for spatial and temporal comparisons, we propose a trapping protocol and a threshold density for assigning the 'ratada' label. Several of the mice implicated in ratadas are reservoirs of emerging diseases, thus emphasizing the need for predictive power to forecast disease epidemics that affect human populations. Further, ratadas may be viewed as pulsed resources, thus enabling us to learn more of the ways communities respond to such intermittent inputs.},
